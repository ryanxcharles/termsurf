## Project Overview

TermSurf is a terminal emulator with an integrated web browser. Users type
`web google.com` in their terminal and a webpage renders directly in the
terminal pane, sharing cookies and sessions across tabs within the same browser
profile.

The project has evolved through four generations:

- **ts1** (Ghostty + WKWebView) — macOS-only. WKWebView had limited API and no
  cross-platform path. Abandoned in favor of CEF.
- **ts2** (WezTerm + in-process CEF) — Embedded CEF directly in WezTerm. CEF
  allows only one `root_cache_path` per process, meaning one browser profile per
  application. Multiple profiles required moving CEF out-of-process. Abandoned.
- **ts3** (WezTerm + out-of-process CEF via XPC) — Each browser profile gets its
  own CEF process, solving the one-profile-per-process limitation. Processes
  communicate with the GUI via XPC Mach port transfer. Superseded by ts4 after
  26 experiments (Issues 325–350) proved CEF's headless off-screen rendering
  caps at ~31fps on macOS.
- **ts4** (Ghostty fork + in-process Chromium) — **Active development.** Forks
  Ghostty as the application (terminal panes are native, in-process). Embeds
  Chromium directly via the Content API (not CEF) for browser panes, with
  multiple browser profiles coexisting in one process. No custom XPC protocol.

**Directory structure:**

- `ts4/` — TermSurf 4.0 (Ghostty fork + in-process Chromium). Active work.
- `ts3/` — TermSurf 3.0 (WezTerm fork + out-of-process CEF). Superseded.
- `ts2/` — TermSurf 2.0 (WezTerm fork + in-process CEF). Superseded.
- `ts1/` — TermSurf 1.x (Ghostty fork + WKWebView). Legacy, still builds.
- `vendor/cef-rs/` — CEF Rust bindings. Used by `ts3/termsurf-profile/`.
- `docs/issues/` — All documentation across all generations.

## TermSurf 4.0 (ts4/) — Active Development

### Architecture

ts4 returns to the ts1 approach — fork Ghostty as the application — with the
critical fix: replace WKWebView (which was too limited) with Chromium embedded
directly via the Content API (not CEF, which cannot sustain 60fps headless).

```
Ghostty Fork (Zig + Swift macOS shell)
├── Terminal panes (in-process, native Ghostty rendering)
├── Browser panes (in-process Chromium via Content API)
│   ├── BrowserContext "work" (Profile 1)
│   ├── BrowserContext "personal" (Profile 2)
│   └── BrowserContext "guest" (Profile N)
├── Pane/tab/split management (inherited from Ghostty)
├── Keybindings, configuration (inherited from Ghostty)
└── Metal renderer (inherited from Ghostty)
```

**Key architectural decisions:**

- **Chromium is in-process.** The browser host runs inside the Ghostty fork's
  process. Chromium may still spawn its own renderer and GPU sub-processes
  internally (this is Chromium's own multi-process architecture and is
  expected). We do not invent a custom XPC or IPC protocol.
- **Multiple profiles in one process.** Chromium's `content::BrowserContext`
  supports multiple instances with different storage paths. Each gets isolated
  cookies, localStorage, and cache. This is what Chrome and Electron do. The
  one-profile-per-process constraint was a CEF limitation, not a Chromium
  limitation (Issue 406).
- **No CEF.** CEF's headless off-screen rendering caps at ~31fps on macOS with
  an event-driven pump, or ~50fps with a busy-wait loop at 100% CPU. 26
  experiments across Issues 325–350 proved this is architectural, not
  configurable. The Content API eliminates every CEF limitation.
- **Fallback.** If multiple profiles cannot coexist in one process in practice,
  we may fall back to a multi-process approach with one Chromium process per
  profile, communicating via XPC (similar to ts3's architecture but with the
  Content API instead of CEF).

### How We Got Here

| Issue | Finding |
| ----- | ------- |
| 400   | Original ts4 vision: own everything, use Content API directly |
| 401   | Content API feasibility study; ~2000 lines of OSR code needed |
| 402   | WezTerm vs Alacritty for terminal (superseded by Issue 404) |
| 403   | Proved multi-process IOSurface compositing works at 60fps |
| 404   | Selected Ghostty as terminal emulator (Metal renderer, IOSurface) |
| 405   | Fork Ghostty with browser out-of-process (Option B selected) |
| 406   | Profile isolation is CEF-only; Content API supports multiple profiles; CEF ruled out |
| 407   | In-process Chromium PoC: two profiles, side by side, high framerate |

### Current Work: Issue 407 PoC

The PoC modifies Chromium's `content_shell` (the minimal Content API embedder)
inside the Chromium source tree. The modifications are small (~5 files) and use
Chromium's native windowed rendering. The resulting `.app` bundle is built by
Chromium's GN/Ninja build system.

**Phases:**

1. **Test page** — Bun app serving a blue spinning square with localStorage
   identity and FPS counter (`ts4/box-demo/public/index.html`, `ts4/box-demo/server.ts`)
2. **Merge Chromium** — Fork Chromium into `termsurf-chromium/` following
   the merge-upstream pattern (depot_tools fetch, move to subdirectory, merge
   unrelated histories)
3. **Build Chromium** — Configure GN, build content_shell with
   `autoninja -C out/Default content_shell`
4. **Modify content_shell** — Add second `ShellBrowserContext` with different
   storage path, display two `WebContents` side by side in one window
5. **Measure** — Verify profile isolation, measure framerate, document findings

**Success criteria:** Two panes in one window, each showing a different
localStorage string that persists across restarts. Both rendering at 60fps or
higher. No custom XPC/IPC protocol.

### Directory Structure

- `ts4/box-demo/public/index.html` — Test page (blue spinning square, localStorage, FPS)
- `ts4/box-demo/server.ts` — Bun HTTP server on port 9407
- `termsurf-chromium/` — Chromium build workspace (gitignored, top level)
  - `src/` — Chromium source tree (git repo)
  - `src/content/shell/` — content_shell (the embedder we modify)
  - `src/out/Default/` — Build output
  - `depot_tools/` — Chromium build tools

### Build Commands

```bash
# Test page server
cd ts4/box-demo && bun run server.ts

# Chromium (depot_tools lives at termsurf-chromium/depot_tools)
cd termsurf-chromium/src
export PATH="$(cd ../depot_tools && pwd):$PATH"
gn gen out/Default --args='is_debug=false symbol_level=0 enable_nacl=false is_component_build=true'
autoninja -C out/Default content_shell
```

### Profile Data

- `~/.config/termsurf/poc/profile-a/` — Profile A storage (PoC)
- `~/.config/termsurf/poc/profile-b/` — Profile B storage (PoC)

## TermSurf 3.0 (ts3/) — Superseded

ts3 used out-of-process CEF via XPC for browser rendering. Superseded by ts4
after 26 experiments (Issues 325–350) proved CEF's headless off-screen rendering
cannot sustain 60fps on macOS. The XPC and IOSurface patterns developed in ts3
remain valuable reference for ts4's fallback architecture.

### Foundational Constraint: One CEF Process Per Profile

**This is the defining architectural rule of ts3.** There must be exactly one
`termsurf-profile` process per browser profile. This is not a design preference
— it is a hard technical constraint:

- CEF's `SingletonLock` file prevents two processes from opening the same
  `root_cache_path`. A second process will crash or fail to initialize.
- CEF Chrome runtime (post-M128) ignores custom `cache_path` — the
  `root_cache_path` IS the profile. One process = one profile.
- Multiple webviews within a single profile process share cookies and storage.
  This is desired behavior — like tabs in a browser.

**Current gap:** The code today spawns a new process for every `web` command.
This is broken for the multi-webview case (two `web google.com` commands with
the same profile). The fix requires the launcher to detect an existing profile
process and send a "create browser" command to it instead of spawning a new one.

### Process Topology

                              IOSurface ──Mach port──▶ GUI ──wgpu──▶ screen
```

### Key Binaries

- **wezterm-gui** — Terminal emulator. Receives IOSurface Mach ports via XPC,
  imports them as wgpu textures, renders webview panes alongside terminal panes.
- **termsurf-launcher** — XPC Mach service (`com.termsurf.launcher`). Spawns
  profile server processes. Relays XPC endpoints between GUI and profile servers
  to enable direct Mach port transfer.
- **termsurf-profile** — One instance per browser profile. Runs CEF off-screen
  rendering. Sends IOSurface Mach ports to GUI when pages render. Manages all
  webviews for its profile.

### Cross-Process IOSurface Sharing

IOSurface IDs are process-local and cannot be shared across processes. Mach
ports can. The sharing flow:

1. GUI creates an anonymous XPC listener, sends its endpoint to the launcher
2. Launcher stores the endpoint, spawns a profile server
3. Profile server claims the endpoint from the launcher (with retry/backoff)
4. Profile server connects directly to GUI via the endpoint
5. CEF renders to IOSurface (`shared_texture_enabled`)
6. Profile server creates a Mach port from the IOSurface handle
   (`IOSurfaceCreateMachPort`)
7. Mach port sent to GUI via XPC (`set_mach_send` / `copy_mach_send`)
8. GUI imports IOSurface from Mach port (`IOSurfaceLookupFromMachPort`)
9. GUI creates wgpu texture from IOSurface for rendering

### IPC Architecture

| Channel              | Transport                       | Protocol       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------- |
| CLI ↔ GUI            | Unix domain socket (`/tmp/`)    | JSON messages  |
| GUI ↔ Launcher       | XPC Mach service                | XPC dictionary |
| GUI ↔ Profile Server | XPC anonymous endpoint (direct) | XPC dictionary |

Note: XPC dictionaries have no `set_f64`/`set_f32` — the scale factor is passed
as a string.

### CEF and Retina Handling

CEF works in logical pixels:

- `view_rect()` returns logical dimensions (e.g., 800x600)
- `screen_info()` returns `device_scale_factor` (e.g., 2.0 for Retina)
- CEF multiplies internally to get physical IOSurface size (e.g., 1600x1200)

Scale factor: `dpi / 72.0` (macOS base DPI = 72, Retina = 144 → scale 2.0). Pane
dimensions come from `Mux::try_get()` → `get_pane()` → `get_dimensions()`, which
returns `pixel_width`, `pixel_height`, `dpi` and is safe to call from any
thread.

### Current Implementation Status

### Build Commands

```bash
cd ts3 && ./scripts/build-debug.sh [--open] [--clean]
cd ts3 && ./scripts/build-release.sh [--open] [--clean]
```

Logs are written to `/tmp/`:

- `~/dev/termsurf/logs/termsurf-gui.log` — GUI process output
- `~/dev/termsurf/logs/termsurf-launcher.log` — Launcher output
- `~/dev/termsurf/logs/termsurf-profile-{session_id}.log` — Per-session profile server output

### Directory Structure and Key Files

**TermSurf-specific crates:**

- `ts3/termsurf-launcher/` — XPC launcher service
  - `src/main.rs` — Listens on `com.termsurf.launcher`, handles `spawn_profile`
    and `claim_session` actions
- `ts3/termsurf-profile/` — CEF profile server
  - `src/main.rs` — CLI args, CEF initialization, render handler that sends
    IOSurface Mach ports, context menu suppression
- `ts3/termsurf-xpc/` — Shared XPC bindings crate
  - `src/ffi.rs` — Raw XPC FFI bindings
  - `src/iosurface.rs` — IOSurface Mach port creation/lookup
- `ts3/termsurf-web/` — Web browser coordinator
- `ts3/termsurf-test-sender/` — Test harness for XPC experiments

**Modified WezTerm files:**

- `ts3/wezterm-gui/src/termwindow/webview_socket.rs` — Unix socket handler for
  `web` command. Looks up pane dimensions via Mux, triggers XPC profile spawn.
- `ts3/wezterm-gui/src/termwindow/webview_xpc.rs` — XPC manager (GUI side).
  Creates listeners, stores received IOSurface Mach ports, maps sessions to
  panes.

**Build scripts:**

- `ts3/scripts/build-debug.sh` — Debug build with `open --stdout --stderr`
- `ts3/scripts/build-release.sh` — Release build

**Profile data:**

- `~/.config/termsurf/cef/<profile>/` — Per-profile CEF data (cookies, cache,
  storage). Not `~/Library/Application Support/` — deliberately cross-platform.

## TermSurf 2.0 (ts2/) — Superseded

ts2 embedded CEF directly inside WezTerm's process. CEF allows only one
`root_cache_path` per process, which means one browser profile per application.
TermSurf requires multiple profiles (like Chrome profiles), so CEF had to move
to separate processes — one per profile. That's ts3.

Historical docs: `docs/issues/ts2-*.md`

## TermSurf 1.x (ts1/) — Legacy

Ghostty fork with WKWebView for browser panes. macOS-only. Still builds.

### Browser Integration

Uses WKWebView (Apple's WebKit) with console message capture, Safari Web
Inspector support, session isolation via WKWebsiteDataStore, and an optional
JavaScript API (`--js-api` flag).

## cef-rs (`vendor/cef-rs/`)

Third-party CEF (Chromium Embedded Framework) Rust bindings, imported and
modified for TermSurf. Used by `ts3/termsurf-profile/` for off-screen browser
rendering.

### TermSurf Modifications to the Library

These are changes to `vendor/cef-rs/cef/src/` (the library itself, not examples):

1. **IOSurface Metal API crash fix** — The original code used
   `std::mem::transmute` to cast raw pointers to Metal API references, causing
   memory corruption. Replaced with properly typed references via the `objc`
   crate. (`vendor/cef-rs/cef/src/osr_texture_import/iosurface.rs`)

2. **sRGB double-correction fix** — CEF outputs sRGB pixel data, but the texture
   pipeline applied gamma correction a second time, washing out all colors.
   Fixed by declaring the correct sRGB format on texture views.
   (`vendor/cef-rs/cef/src/osr_texture_import/common.rs`, `iosurface.rs`)

3. **IOSurface IPC module (failed experiment)** — Added `iosurface_ipc.rs` to
   share IOSurface across processes via IOSurface IDs. This failed because
   IOSurface IDs are process-local. This failure directly motivated the Mach
   port approach used in ts3. Module is deprecated.

4. **Mach port support for IOSurface** — Extended `iosurface.rs` with
   `IOSurfaceCreateMachPort` and `IOSurfaceLookupFromMachPort` for cross-process
   texture sharing. This is what ts3 uses to send rendered surfaces from the
   profile server to the GUI.

### OSR Example Validation

The OSR (off-screen rendering) example in `vendor/cef-rs/examples/osr/` was used as a
testbed before ts1 integration. Changes made to the example:

| Feature                    | Status     | Notes                                       |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| IOSurface texture import   | Working    | Fixed Metal API types in `iosurface.rs`     |
| Input handling             | Working    | Keyboard, mouse, scroll all functional      |
| Multiple browser instances | Working    | Per-instance TextureHolder, HashMap routing |
| Event-driven rendering     | Working    | Render only when CEF signals new frame      |
| Resize handling            | Working    | Browser resizes with window                 |
| Context menu               | Suppressed | Prevents winit NSApplication crash          |
| macOS terminal launch      | Fixed      | NSApp activation policy for multi-browser   |
| Fullscreen                 | Broken     | winit issue, defer to WezTerm               |
