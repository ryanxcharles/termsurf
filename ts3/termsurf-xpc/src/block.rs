//! Safe block-based event handlers for XPC connections.
//!
//! This module provides Rust closure wrappers for XPC event handlers,
//! using the `block2` crate to create Objective-C blocks.

/// Set an event handler on a connection using a Rust closure.
///
/// The closure receives parsed events: `Ok(XpcDictionary)` for messages,
/// or `Err(XpcError)` for connection errors.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// set_event_handler(&conn, |event| {
///     match event {
///         Ok(msg) => println!("Received: {:?}", msg.get_string("action")),
///         Err(e) => eprintln!("Error: {}", e),
///     }
/// });
/// ```
///
/// # Safety Note
///
/// The handler block is leaked to ensure it lives as long as the connection.
/// This is acceptable for long-lived connections but will leak memory if
/// connections are created and destroyed frequently.

    });

/// Set a handler for new incoming connections on a listener.
///
/// For XPC service listeners, each incoming client gets its own connection.
/// For anonymous listeners, this receives peer connections.
///
/// # CRITICAL: Peer Connection Lifetime
///
/// **You MUST store the peer connection to keep it alive.** When the handler
/// returns, the `XpcConnection` is dropped, which cancels the connection.
/// If you don't store the peer, you'll see "connection interrupted" errors
/// and messages won't be delivered.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// // Storage for peer connections - REQUIRED
/// let peers: Arc<Mutex<Vec<XpcConnection>>> = Arc::new(Mutex::new(Vec::new()));
/// let peers_clone = peers.clone();
///
/// set_new_connection_handler(&listener, move |peer| {
///     println!("New connection!");
///     set_event_handler(&peer, |event| {
///         // Handle messages from this peer
///     });
///     peer.resume();
///
///     // CRITICAL: Store the peer to keep it alive!
///     peers_clone.lock().unwrap().push(peer);
/// });
/// ```
///
/// # Common Mistake
///
/// ```ignore
/// // WRONG - peer is dropped when handler returns, connection canceled!
/// set_new_connection_handler(&listener, |peer| {
///     set_event_handler(&peer, |event| { ... });
///     peer.resume();
///     // peer dropped here → connection immediately canceled
/// });
