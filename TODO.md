## Future issues

Problems identified but not yet started. Each becomes its own issue doc when
ready.

- [ ] Renderer crash UX — When the Chromium renderer process dies, the user sees
      a blank white screen with no indication of what happened. The progress bar
      continues as if the page is still loading, then times out. Need to detect
      renderer termination, display an error page, clear the progress bar, and
      show what went wrong. Discovered in Issue 655 Experiment 1.
- [ ] Mojo interface audit — The Content API build is missing handlers for Mojo
      interfaces that a full Chrome browser registers. Every missing binder is a
      ticking time bomb — the renderer crashes when any page's JavaScript calls
      that API. Fixed `blink.mojom.BadgeService` in Issue 655, but there are
      likely many more. Need to systematically review all Mojo interfaces.
      Discovered in Issue 655 Experiment 1.
