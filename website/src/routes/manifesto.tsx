          We surf by day. We hack by night. We build TermSurf so we never have to leave.
        </p>
        <p>
          We live in the terminal. It is our cockpit. Total control. Every
          process, every socket, every file — all reachable from a single prompt.
          The terminal does not hide things. It does not decide what we are
          allowed to see. We have root. We are the operators.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then there is the browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          Browsers are designed for the lowest common denominator. They hide the
          network. They hide the DOM. They wrap everything in a GUI built for
          people who do not know what a process is. Chrome has three billion
          users. It is optimized for all of them. It is optimized for none of
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are not the lowest common denominator. We need to inspect every
          request. Override every header. Pipe responses into scripts. Open
          DevTools in a split pane while tailing logs in another. We need the web
          the same way we need the filesystem — raw, fast, and under complete
          control.
        </p>
        <p>
          The browser we need does not exist. Not as a standalone app. The app is
          the wrong container. The right container is the terminal — where
          everything else already lives. The browser should be a pane. It should
          sit next to the shell, next to the editor, next to the logs. It should
          resize with a keystroke. It should speak protobuf over a Unix socket.
          It should be a component in the system, not a system unto itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          So we built TermSurf.
        </p>
        <p>
          TermSurf is a protocol for jacking web browsers into terminal
          emulators. Full Chromium. Full GPU rendering. Zero-copy compositing.
          Type{" "}
          <code className="text-accent">web localhost:3000</code> and the page
          is there — right next to your shell. No alt-tab. No context switch. No
          lowest common denominator.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we are not in the water, we are in the terminal. And now the web
          is there too.
