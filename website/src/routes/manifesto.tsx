        <p>We need total control.</p>
        <p>
          The terminal gave us that. Every process, every socket, every file —
          reachable from a single prompt. The terminal does not hide things. It
          does not decide what we are allowed to see. We are the admins. We are
          the operators. We are in charge.
        </p>
        <p>The browser took it away.</p>
        <p>
          Big tech brought the web to three billion people. That is a real
          achievement. But Chrome, Safari, and Edge are built for newbs. They
          hide the network. They hide the DOM. They wrap everything in a GUI for
          NPCs who do not know what a process is. You cannot pipe a browser. You
          cannot script it. You cannot embed it in your workflow. The browser is
          a walled garden on an open operating system. It is the last system on
          your machine that you do not control.
        </p>
        <p>
          We aren't civilians. We inspect every request. Override
          every header. Pipe responses into scripts. Open DevTools in a split
          pane while tailing logs in another. We need the web the same way we
          need the filesystem — raw, fast, and under <em>our</em> complete
          control.
        </p>
        <p>
          The browser we need does not exist as a standalone app. The window is
          the wrong container. The right container is the terminal — where
          everything else already lives. The browser should be a TUI, like
          Neovim or Lazygit. It should sit in the shell, next to the editor,
          next to the repo, next to the logs. It should resize with a keystroke.
          It should speak protobuf over a Unix socket. It should be a component
          in the system, not walled garden.
        </p>
        <p>
          So we built TermSurf. Full Chromium. Full GPU rendering. Zero-copy
          compositing. Type{" "}
          <code className="text-accent">web localhost:3000</code> and the page
          is there — right next to your shell. <em>In</em> your shell. No
          alt-tab. No context switch. No walled garden.
        </p>
        <p>We surf by day. We hack by night. We build TermSurf for us.</p>
        <p>
          We are <em>root</em>.
