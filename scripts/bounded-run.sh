#!/usr/bin/env bash

# bounded-run.sh <logfile> <cmd...>
#
# Run <cmd...>, streaming all output to <logfile>, under TWO independent kills:
#
#   * HARD_CAP (900s = 15 minutes): absolute wall-clock ceiling. The command is
#     SIGKILLed and the wrapper exits no matter what — this is the guarantee that
#     no run can ever take longer than 15 minutes (Issue 801).
#   * IDLE_CAP (90s): if the log stops growing (no test makes progress), the
#     command is killed early as a likely hang. A `sample` of the process group is
#     captured to <logfile>.hang before the kill.
#
# The wrapper ALWAYS writes a final `STATUS=...` line and exits within HARD_CAP,
# including the degenerate cases where the command dies instantly or produces no
# output (the poll loop ends immediately, `wait` returns, STATUS=COMPLETED). There
# is no code path in which this script runs forever.
#
# Usage (the ONLY supported pattern): launch this as a single tracked background
# task and wait for that task's own completion notification. Do NOT wrap it in a
# `&`-launcher, and do NOT poll a separate watcher for a success marker — both
# create unbounded waits this script exists to eliminate. On wake, read the
# STATUS line: HARD_TIMEOUT / IDLE_KILL is a failure (with a captured sample);
# an empty log or an instant COMPLETED is also a failure to investigate, never a
# silent pass.
