# Issue 774: Zooming non-browser pane leaves webview overlay visible

## Goal

When zooming a non-browser pane, the browser webview overlay must be hidden so
the zoomed pane is fully visible without obstruction.

## Background

Wezboard supports "zooming" a pane, which temporarily hides all other panes in
the same tab and expands the selected pane to fill the entire tab area. This
works correctly when zooming a browser pane — the webview scales to fill the
space.

However, when zooming a non-browser pane (e.g. a terminal pane) while a browser
pane exists in the same tab, the other panes vanish as expected but the
browser's webview overlay remains visible on top of the zoomed pane. The
CALayerHost overlay is not hidden or repositioned when its owning pane is hidden
by the zoom.

This makes zooming useless for any non-webview pane in a tab that also contains
a browser pane, because the webview covers part or all of the zoomed content.

## Analysis

The zoom operation hides panes at the mux/layout level, but the webview overlay
(rendered via CALayerHost compositing) is managed separately from the pane
layout system. When a pane is hidden by zoom, the corresponding browser overlay
must also be hidden. When zoom is exited, the overlay must be restored.

The fix likely involves:

1. Detecting when a zoom hides a browser pane and sending a message to hide/show
   the overlay.
2. Or updating the overlay position/visibility during the zoom layout
   recalculation so overlays for non-visible panes are hidden.
