# Experiment 2: Implement theme-derived split border colors

## Description

Implement the Experiment 1 audit result in Ghostboard without modifying bundled
theme files.

The new behavior should be:

- explicit `focused-split-border-color` config still wins;
- explicit `unfocused-split-border-color` config still wins;
- unset focused split border color derives from the active theme palette:
  - use palette 6 when its contrast against `background` is at least 2.0;
  - otherwise choose the highest-contrast available entry from palette 14, 4,
    and 12;
- unset unfocused split border color derives from palette 8;
- `split-border-width = 0` remains the default and still disables drawing;
- TokyoNight with no explicit border colors derives focused `#7dcfff` and
  unfocused `#414868`.

This experiment should make the user-facing behavior true, add targeted tests,
and update documentation. It must not vendor, patch, or modify theme files.

## Changes

- `ghostboard/macos/Sources/Ghostty/Ghostty.Config.swift`
  - Add a helper for converting `ghostty_config_color_s` to SwiftUI `Color`.
  - Add a helper for reading the effective `palette` through
    `ghostty_config_get` into `ghostty_config_palette_s`.
  - Add contrast helpers scoped to split border fallback selection.
  - Change `focusedSplitBorderColor` so an unset `focused-split-border-color`
    derives from palette 6 with the audited contrast fallback to palette 14, 4,
    and 12.
  - Change `unfocusedSplitBorderColor` so an unset
    `unfocused-split-border-color` derives from palette 8.
  - Preserve `nil` only for the no-config-object or no-palette failure case.
- `ghostboard/src/config/CApi.zig`
  - Add targeted C API tests proving both border color keys return false when
    unset and true with the exact configured color when explicitly set.
  - Keep the config fields nullable; do not convert the Zig defaults to concrete
    colors.
- `ghostboard/macos/Tests/Ghostty/ConfigTests.swift`
  - Add tests proving a TokyoNight-style palette derives focused `#7dcfff` and
    unfocused `#414868` with no explicit border colors.
  - Add tests proving explicit focused and unfocused border color config
    overrides the derived values independently.
  - Add a test or assertion proving `splitBorderWidth` remains `0` when unset.
  - Add a focused fallback test where palette 6 is below 2.0 contrast and the
    derived focused color comes from the best candidate among palette 14, 4,
    and 12.
- `website/src/content/docs/reference/config.md`
  - Update focused and unfocused split border color descriptions so unset values
    are documented as theme-derived.
- `website/src/content/docs/split-pane-borders.mdx`
  - Update the guide so users know they can omit border color values to use the
    active theme, while explicit config overrides still work.

No `ghostboard/zig-out`, theme source package, vendoring metadata, or bundled
theme file should be changed.

## Verification

1. Confirm no bundled/generated theme files or theme dependency metadata were
   changed:

   ```bash
   git status --short -- ghostboard/zig-out ghostboard/build.zig.zon
   git diff --name-only | rg '(^ghostboard/zig-out/|ghostboard/build.zig.zon|themes/)'
   ```

   Pass: no output.

2. Run Zig config/API tests:

   ```bash
   cd ghostboard
   zig build test
   ```

   Pass: targeted C API tests prove unset border colors remain nullable at the
   Zig/C boundary and explicit config values are returned exactly.

3. Run macOS tests:

   ```bash
   cd ghostboard
   macos/build.nu --action test
   ```

   Pass: `Ghostty.Config` tests prove TokyoNight derivation, focused fallback,
   explicit override behavior, and unchanged default `splitBorderWidth`.

4. Build the macOS app:

   ```bash
   cd ghostboard
   macos/build.nu --configuration Debug --action build
   ```

   Pass: the app builds successfully.

5. Run formatting and hygiene checks:

   ```bash
   cd ghostboard
   zig fmt --check src/config/CApi.zig
   swiftlint
   cd ..
   prettier --check issues/0839-theme-defined-split-border-colors/README.md \
     issues/0839-theme-defined-split-border-colors/02-implement-theme-derived-split-border-colors.md \
     website/src/content/docs/reference/config.md \
     website/src/content/docs/split-pane-borders.mdx
   git diff --check
   ```

   Pass: all available checks succeed. If `swiftlint` is unavailable, record
   that explicitly in the result and rely on the macOS test/build checks for
   Swift compilation.

6. Manual behavior check:

   - Use `theme = tokyonight` and `split-border-width = 2`.
   - Remove explicit `focused-split-border-color` and
     `unfocused-split-border-color`.
   - Launch a debug Ghostboard app and create at least two split panes.

   Pass: focused split border uses Tokyo Night cyan `#7dcfff`; unfocused split
   border uses `#414868`. Re-adding explicit border color config overrides the
   derived values. Removing or setting `split-border-width = 0` disables drawing
   even though derived colors are available.

## Design Review

Reviewed by a fresh-context Codex adversarial subagent.

Final verdict: **Approved**.

No required findings. The reviewer confirmed that the design follows the
Experiment 1 audit result, preserves nullable Zig config and explicit override
behavior, avoids theme vendoring, keeps `split-border-width` opt-in, and
includes concrete Zig, Swift, build, formatting, documentation, and manual
behavior verification.
