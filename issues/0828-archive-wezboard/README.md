# Issue 828: Archive Wezboard

## Goal

Archive Wezboard by deleting `wezboard/` from the TermSurf repository and
recording the exact commit hash where the deletion lands.

When solved, Ghostboard remains the primary TermSurf front-end, Wezboard source
code is no longer present in the repo, and the issue documents the deletion
commit hash so the archived implementation can be recovered from git history.

## Background

Wezboard was the active TermSurf GUI while Ghostboard was archived and later
rebuilt. Ghostboard has now returned as the primary front-end. Keeping Wezboard
in the repo adds size, build surface, and maintenance burden for a deprecated
implementation.

The archive mechanism for this issue is intentionally simple: delete the
`wezboard/` directory from the repo. Do not move it to another folder inside the
same repo. Git history is the archive.

## Analysis

The deletion commit is the key artifact. A commit cannot contain its own hash,
so the deletion experiment should land first, then a follow-up issue-document
commit should record the exact deletion commit hash in the experiment result and
final conclusion.

The implementation should also update active documentation and scripts that
still claim Wezboard is an installable or buildable current component. Those
updates should be scoped to avoiding broken references after `wezboard/` is
deleted. Historical issue documents remain immutable and should not be changed.

Initial active surfaces to audit include:

```text
AGENTS.md
README.md
docs/
homebrew/
scripts/
test-html/
webtui/
website/
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- `wezboard/` is deleted from the repository.
- The exact deletion commit hash is recorded in this issue.
- Active build, install, uninstall, release, and documentation surfaces no
  longer advertise Wezboard as a current component.
- Historical closed issues are not rewritten.
- Ghostboard remains documented as the primary TermSurf front-end.
- The issue conclusion records how to recover Wezboard from git history.

## Notes

Do not create experiments upfront. Design Experiment 1 after this issue is open.
