# Issue 745: Research self-hosted Git with database storage

## Goal

Determine whether we can self-host Git repositories — including the main
TermSurf repo, releases, and the Chromium fork — using a database backend
instead of the filesystem, while remaining fully compatible with standard Git
operations (`git push`, `git pull`, `git clone`).

## Background

The TermSurf website (`website/`) is evolving into a hub. The next step is
self-hosting our Git repositories so that the website serves as the central
source of truth — code hosting, releases, user accounts, and project management
in one place.

### Why not filesystem-based Git hosting?

Traditional Git hosting (Gitea, GitLab, Gogs) stores repositories as bare Git
repos on the filesystem. This works, but:

- **Operational complexity** — Backups require filesystem snapshots or rsync.
  Scaling means managing disk I/O, NFS mounts, or distributed filesystems.
- **Chromium is enormous** — The Chromium repo is ~110 GB. Filesystem-based
  hosting for a repo this size requires careful disk management, and operations
  like garbage collection become expensive.
- **Database advantages** — A database gives us transactions, replication,
  point-in-time recovery, and the ability to query Git objects (commits, trees,
  blobs) directly. It also simplifies the deployment model — one backing store
  for everything.

### What we need

1. **Full Git protocol compatibility** — Users must be able to `git clone`,
   `git push`, `git pull`, and `git fetch` using standard Git clients. No custom
   tooling on the client side.
2. **Database-backed object storage** — Git objects (blobs, trees, commits,
   tags) stored in a database rather than as loose objects or packfiles on disk.
3. **Scale to Chromium** — Must handle repositories with millions of objects and
   tens of gigabytes of data.
4. **Self-hostable** — Runs on our infrastructure, not a SaaS dependency.

### Research questions

1. **What existing tools or libraries implement a Git backend on top of a
   database?** Examples might include custom Git object storage backends,
   virtual filesystems, or Git protocol servers that translate operations into
   database queries.

2. **What databases are suitable?** PostgreSQL with large object support? Object
   storage (S3) with a metadata database? A key-value store like TiKV or
   FoundationDB? Something purpose-built?

3. **How does the Git smart HTTP/SSH protocol work at the transport level?**
   Specifically, what does a server need to implement to handle `git push` and
   `git pull`? Understanding this helps evaluate whether we can intercept at the
   protocol level and route to a database.

4. **How do existing large-scale Git hosts handle this?** GitHub, GitLab.com,
   and Bitbucket all operate at scales far beyond filesystem-based hosting.
   What's known about their architectures? (GitHub's Spokes/DGit, GitLab's
   Gitaly, etc.)

5. **Are there Git libraries (in Rust, Go, or TypeScript) that abstract object
   storage?** For example, `gitoxide` (Rust) or `go-git` (Go) — do they support
   pluggable backends?

6. **What about partial/shallow clones and Git LFS?** Chromium uses neither LFS
   nor shallow clones by default, but supporting these could reduce bandwidth
   and storage requirements.

7. **Is there a hybrid approach?** For example, serving the Git protocol from a
   lightweight process that reads/writes to a database, while using a CDN or
   object store for large blobs.

### Known projects to investigate

- **Gitaly** (GitLab) — Git RPC service. Abstracts Git operations behind gRPC.
  Filesystem-backed but interesting architecture.
- **Spokes / DGit** (GitHub) — GitHub's distributed Git storage. Not
  open-source, but architecture is documented in blog posts.
- **go-git** — Pure Go Git implementation with pluggable storage backends
  (memory, filesystem, custom). Could potentially back onto a database.
- **gitoxide** — Pure Rust Git implementation. May support custom object
  databases.
- **Jujutsu (jj)** — Git-compatible VCS with a different internal model. Uses
  its own storage but interops with Git.
- **Dulwich** — Pure Python Git implementation with pluggable backends.
- **git-lfs-s3** / **Git LFS** — Large file storage over S3. Relevant for
  handling Chromium's size.
- **Noms / Dolt** — Version-controlled databases. Opposite direction (database
  with Git semantics) but architecturally interesting.
- **Soft Serve** — Self-hosted Git server (Go, Charm). Filesystem-backed but
  minimal and hackable.
- **Forgejo / Gitea** — Self-hosted Git forges. Filesystem-backed, but worth
  understanding their protocol handling.
