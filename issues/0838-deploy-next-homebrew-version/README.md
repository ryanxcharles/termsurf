# Issue 838: Deploy Next Homebrew Version

## Goal

Deploy the next TermSurf version to Homebrew so users can install the latest
shipped changes with:

```bash
brew tap termsurf/termsurf
brew trust termsurf/termsurf
brew install --cask termsurf
```

## Background

The next issue number is **838**. Issues 834 and 835 are already occupied by
upstream work, Issue 836 is the closed WebTUI top-controls change, and Issue 837
is the closed website revamp issue.

The current Homebrew cask is `homebrew/Casks/termsurf.rb` and currently points
at TermSurf `1.0.0`. The existing release pipeline is:

1. Build all release components with `scripts/build.sh all --release`.
2. Package and publish with `scripts/release.sh <version>`.
3. The release script uploads the tarball to GitHub Releases and updates the
   `termsurf/homebrew-termsurf` cask.

The WebTUI top-controls fix from Issue 836 is in the repo and should be included
in the next Homebrew deployment.

The target version for this deployment is **TermSurf `1.4.0`**. Local tags
already include `v1.0.1` through `v1.3.1`, so `1.4.0` is the next non-colliding
minor version for a release that adds Surfari packaging.

Surfari is a required part of this release. This Homebrew version must ship with
Surfari, not just Roamium plus the WebTUI top-controls fix. Surfari support is
present in the repo and Ghostboard can resolve Surfari via
`TERMSURF_SURFARI_PATH`, but Surfari is not currently wired into the main
release packaging path:

- `scripts/build.sh all` does not build Surfari or `libtermsurf_webkit`.
- `scripts/install.sh all` does not install Surfari.
- `scripts/release.sh` does not package Surfari or `libtermsurf_webkit`.
- `homebrew/Casks/termsurf.rb` does not install Surfari.
- Ghostboard does not currently resolve an installed Surfari path analogous to
  the installed Roamium path.

This machine has not yet built Surfari. Before publishing `1.4.0`, the issue
must bootstrap the local WebKit workspace and prove Surfari builds here:

1. Shallow clone WebKit into `webkit/src`.
2. Fetch and switch to the documented WebKit base commit
   `1452a43959523449099b2616793fd2c5b6a6487e`.
3. Apply TermSurf's WebKit patch archive from `webkit/patches/issue-756/`.
4. Install or verify the required macOS build prerequisites, including full
   Xcode and the Metal toolchain.
5. Build WebKit with `webkit/src/Tools/Scripts/build-webkit --debug`.
6. Build `surfari/libtermsurf_webkit/build/libtermsurf_webkit.dylib`.
7. Build the `surfari` Rust binary.
8. Wire Surfari into TermSurf build, install, release, Homebrew, and installed
   Ghostboard browser resolution before deployment.

## Scope

This issue covers the next Homebrew deployment. It may include:

- deploying version `1.4.0`;
- confirming the release contents;
- bootstrapping and building WebKit on this machine;
- building `libtermsurf_webkit` and `surfari`;
- wiring Surfari into build/install/release/Homebrew flows;
- verifying release builds;
- running the release script;
- verifying the generated GitHub release artifact;
- verifying the Homebrew cask update;
- installing the cask from a clean or existing Homebrew install;
- documenting any deployment blockers.

## Major Stages

- [x] **Stage 1: WebKit workspace bootstrap** — shallow clone `webkit/src`,
      switch to `1452a43959523449099b2616793fd2c5b6a6487e`, apply
      `webkit/patches/issue-756/`, and record the resulting WebKit state.
- [x] **Stage 2: WebKit build** — verify Xcode/Metal prerequisites and build
      WebKit with `webkit/src/Tools/Scripts/build-webkit --debug`.
- [x] **Stage 3: Surfari local build** — build
      `surfari/libtermsurf_webkit/build/libtermsurf_webkit.dylib`, run its smoke
      test, and build the `surfari` Rust binary.
- [x] **Stage 4: Surfari packaging integration** — wire Surfari into
      `scripts/build.sh`, `scripts/install.sh`, `scripts/release.sh`,
      `homebrew/Casks/termsurf.rb`, and Ghostboard's installed browser
      resolution.
- [x] **Stage 5: Full release build** — run the full `1.4.0` release build and
      verify Roamium, Surfari, WebTUI, and Ghostboard artifacts are present.
- [x] **Stage 6: Package-only release validation** — generate the `1.4.0`
      tarball without publishing and inspect it for `TermSurf.app`, `web`,
      Roamium, Surfari, and required runtime resources.
- [x] **Stage 7: Publish release** — publish GitHub Release `v1.4.0`, update and
      push the Homebrew cask, and record the generated SHA.
- [x] **Stage 8: Homebrew install verification** — install or upgrade through
      Homebrew and verify WebTUI top controls plus `web --browser surfari`
      without `TERMSURF_SURFARI_PATH`.
- [x] **Stage 9: Closeout** — record final verification evidence, update docs if
      deployment changed install instructions, close the issue, and regenerate
      `issues/README.md`.

## Experiments

- [Experiment 1: Bootstrap WebKit and Surfari](01-bootstrap-webkit-surfari.md) —
  **Partial** (smoke test fails on focus observation)
- [Experiment 2: Restore Surfari focus activation](02-restore-surfari-focus-activation.md)
  — **Pass**
- [Experiment 3: Wire Surfari into packaging paths](03-wire-surfari-packaging-paths.md)
  — **Partial** (Surfari wiring works, but packaged runtime needs WebKit
  closure)
- [Experiment 4: Package Surfari WebKit runtime](04-package-surfari-webkit-runtime.md)
  — **Pass**
- [Experiment 5: Full release build](05-full-release-build.md) — **Pass**
- [Experiment 6: Package-only release validation](06-package-only-release-validation.md)
  — **Pass**
- [Experiment 7: Publish release 1.4.0](07-publish-release-1-4-0.md) — **Pass**
- [Experiment 8: Homebrew install verification](08-homebrew-install-verification.md)
  — **Pass**

## Acceptance Criteria

- The issue records the intended next version number: `1.4.0`.
- Surfari is included in this deployment.
- WebKit is shallow-cloned, patched, and built on this machine.
- `libtermsurf_webkit` builds on this machine.
- The `surfari` Rust binary builds on this machine.
- `scripts/build.sh all --release` includes Surfari.
- Release builds complete successfully.
- The packaged tarball contains the expected installable artifacts, including
  Surfari and its required `libtermsurf_webkit` runtime dependency.
- GitHub Release upload succeeds for the chosen version.
- The Homebrew cask is updated and pushed to the Homebrew tap.
- A Homebrew install or upgrade test succeeds.
- Installed TermSurf includes the WebTUI top-controls fix.
- Installed Surfari can be launched through `web --browser surfari` without
  relying on a development-only `TERMSURF_SURFARI_PATH`.

## Conclusion

Issue 838 is complete. TermSurf `1.4.0` was built, packaged, published to GitHub
Releases, pushed to the `termsurf/homebrew-termsurf` tap, and verified through a
real Homebrew upgrade/reinstall on this machine.

Final release evidence:

- GitHub Release `v1.4.0` exists and is not draft or prerelease.
- Release asset `termsurf-1.4.0-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz` has SHA
  `efb72712b962c77605df9ee2b67cfda2e116fd39cb863588b62df1b1857ea260`.
- Homebrew tap `main` is pushed to `1113ef1b3f790a7e51991c5389b35c93700b3e79`.
- Installed cask `termsurf` reports version `1.4.0`.
- Installed artifacts include `TermSurf.app`, `web`, Roamium, Surfari,
  `libtermsurf_webkit.dylib`, `libWebKitSwift.dylib`, and the required Surfari
  WebKit runtime closure.
- Installed WebTUI carries the Issue 836 top-controls fix; the installed `web`
  binary matches the release build by Mach-O UUID, and the Issue 836 regression
  tests pass.
- Installed Surfari has no broken symlinks and passes strict code-signature
  verification.
- Installed Ghostboard launches installed `web --browser surfari` without
  `TERMSURF_SURFARI_PATH`, both through the explicit installed-path harness
  override and through Ghostboard's production default `/opt/homebrew` Surfari
  path.

Two release-quality fixes were found and completed during final validation:

- release packaging now signs the staged Surfari runtime after path rewriting,
  includes `libWebKitSwift.dylib`, materializes WebKit framework runtime
  symlinks, and fails closed on signing errors;
- the Homebrew cask now clears quarantine before signing, so WebKit `.tbd`
  detached signatures survive postflight.
