# Issue 838: Deploy Next Homebrew Version

## Goal

Deploy the next TermSurf version to Homebrew so users can install the latest
shipped changes with:

```bash
brew tap termsurf/termsurf
brew trust termsurf/termsurf
brew install --cask termsurf
```

## Background

The next issue number is **838**. Issues 834 and 835 are already occupied by
upstream work, Issue 836 is the closed WebTUI top-controls change, and Issue 837
is the closed website revamp issue.

The current Homebrew cask is `homebrew/Casks/termsurf.rb` and currently points
at TermSurf `1.0.0`. The existing release pipeline is:

1. Build all release components with `scripts/build.sh all --release`.
2. Package and publish with `scripts/release.sh <version>`.
3. The release script uploads the tarball to GitHub Releases and updates the
   `termsurf/homebrew-termsurf` cask.

The WebTUI top-controls fix from Issue 836 is in the repo and should be included
in the next Homebrew deployment.

The target version for this deployment is **TermSurf `1.4.0`**. Local tags
already include `v1.0.1` through `v1.3.1`, so `1.4.0` is the next non-colliding
minor version for a release that adds Surfari packaging.

Surfari is a required part of this release. This Homebrew version must ship with
Surfari, not just Roamium plus the WebTUI top-controls fix. Surfari support is
present in the repo and Ghostboard can resolve Surfari via
`TERMSURF_SURFARI_PATH`, but Surfari is not currently wired into the main
release packaging path:

- `scripts/build.sh all` does not build Surfari or `libtermsurf_webkit`.
- `scripts/install.sh all` does not install Surfari.
- `scripts/release.sh` does not package Surfari or `libtermsurf_webkit`.
- `homebrew/Casks/termsurf.rb` does not install Surfari.
- Ghostboard does not currently resolve an installed Surfari path analogous to
  the installed Roamium path.

This machine has not yet built Surfari. Before publishing `1.4.0`, the issue
must bootstrap the local WebKit workspace and prove Surfari builds here:

1. Shallow clone WebKit into `webkit/src`.
2. Fetch and switch to the documented WebKit base commit
   `1452a43959523449099b2616793fd2c5b6a6487e`.
3. Apply TermSurf's WebKit patch archive from `webkit/patches/issue-756/`.
4. Install or verify the required macOS build prerequisites, including full
   Xcode and the Metal toolchain.
5. Build WebKit with `webkit/src/Tools/Scripts/build-webkit --debug`.
6. Build `surfari/libtermsurf_webkit/build/libtermsurf_webkit.dylib`.
7. Build the `surfari` Rust binary.
8. Wire Surfari into TermSurf build, install, release, Homebrew, and installed
   Ghostboard browser resolution before deployment.

## Scope

This issue covers the next Homebrew deployment. It may include:

- deploying version `1.4.0`;
- confirming the release contents;
- bootstrapping and building WebKit on this machine;
- building `libtermsurf_webkit` and `surfari`;
- wiring Surfari into build/install/release/Homebrew flows;
- verifying release builds;
- running the release script;
- verifying the generated GitHub release artifact;
- verifying the Homebrew cask update;
- installing the cask from a clean or existing Homebrew install;
- documenting any deployment blockers.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The issue records the intended next version number: `1.4.0`.
- Surfari is included in this deployment.
- WebKit is shallow-cloned, patched, and built on this machine.
- `libtermsurf_webkit` builds on this machine.
- The `surfari` Rust binary builds on this machine.
- `scripts/build.sh all --release` includes Surfari.
- Release builds complete successfully.
- The packaged tarball contains the expected installable artifacts, including
  Surfari and its required `libtermsurf_webkit` runtime dependency.
- GitHub Release upload succeeds for the chosen version.
- The Homebrew cask is updated and pushed to the Homebrew tap.
- A Homebrew install or upgrade test succeeds.
- Installed TermSurf includes the WebTUI top-controls fix.
- Installed Surfari can be launched through `web --browser surfari` without
  relying on a development-only `TERMSURF_SURFARI_PATH`.
