# Issue 756: Surfari — WebKit engine for TermSurf

## Goal

Build Surfari, the WebKit-based browser engine for TermSurf. Surfari proves that
the TermSurf protocol is truly engine-agnostic by running a second browser
engine alongside Roamium (Chromium) in the same terminal window.

## Background

### Why WebKit first

TermSurf claims to be a protocol that works with any engine, but it currently
only runs Chromium. Shipping a second engine proves the architecture. WebKit is
the best candidate because:

- **Smallest embedding surface.** WebKit's embedding API is simpler than
  Chromium's Content API.
- **Prior art.** TermSurf 1.x (ts1) already implemented a full WKWebView
  integration with Ghostty, including navigation, DevTools, profiles, downloads,
  and console capture (Issue 108). We know the API well.
- **Cross-platform.** WebKit builds on macOS, Linux (WebKitGTK, WPE), and can be
  built on Windows. This matters for TermSurf's cross-platform goals.

### Why we must build WebKit from source

TermSurf 1.x used the system `WebKit.framework` (WKWebView) on macOS. This
worked for a prototype but hit serious limitations documented across Issues
100–108:

**macOS-only.** WKWebView is an Apple framework. It does not exist on Linux or
Windows. TermSurf needs to run on all three platforms. Building WebKit from
source gives us WebKitGTK on Linux and a custom build on Windows.

**No console capture API.** WKWebView has no native API for capturing console
output (Issue 102). We had to inject JavaScript at document start to override
`console.log`, `console.error`, `console.warn`, and `console.info`, then
serialize objects with `JSON.stringify()`. No structured console API exists.

**Broken HTTP headers.** WKWebView does not send the
`Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1` header that Safari sends (Issue 108). Google and
other sites serve simplified/mobile layouts as a result. Apple has an open radar
(rdar://50057283) with no fix. The workaround — intercepting navigation and
injecting the header manually — only works for top-level requests, not XHR/fetch
or subresources.

**No native target="\_blank" handling.** WKWebView drops links requesting new
windows (Issue 107). The workaround loads them in the same webview, but loses
the original page context. OAuth flows relying on popups do not work.

**Private API dependency for DevTools.** Enabling Web Inspector requires
`setValue(true, forKey: "developerExtrasEnabled")` — an undocumented private
configuration key (Issue 108). The `_WKInspector` API uses a leading underscore,
indicating it is not public.

**Key event interception hacks.** WKWebView captures all key events when focused
(Issue 104). We had to use `NSEvent.addLocalMonitorForEvents` to intercept
Ctrl+C globally before WKWebView sees it. WKWebView's `performKeyEquivalent`
claims cmd+c/x/v (returns `true`) but does not actually execute the operations —
we had to convert to `NSApp.sendAction` to trigger menu actions.

**No process-level control.** The system framework runs WebContent processes
that we cannot configure, inspect, or control. Building from source gives us
access to `WebPageProxy`, `WebProcessPool`, compositor internals, and the
ability to add our own C API hooks.

Building WebKit from source eliminates all of these limitations. We get full
control over the engine, the same way we have full control over Chromium via our
fork.

### Architecture

Surfari follows the same pattern as Roamium:

```
libtermsurf_webkit (Objective-C/C++, C API)
        ↓ links
    Surfari (Rust binary, ~400 lines)
        ↓ connects via Unix socket
    Wezboard (GUI)
```

- `libtermsurf_webkit` — Objective-C/C++ library wrapping WebKit's internal
  APIs, exporting C functions with `ts_*` signatures matching the same API as
  `libtermsurf_chromium`.
- Surfari — Rust binary handling Unix socket IPC, protobuf parsing, and process
  lifecycle. Almost entirely reusable from Roamium.

### Compositing: the key open question

Chromium uses CALayerHost for zero-copy GPU compositing. A `CAContext` ID
crosses the process boundary over a Unix socket, and Wezboard creates a
`CALayerHost` with that ID. This is the core rendering mechanism.

WebKit's rendering is tied to its view hierarchy. The key question: how do we
get WebKit's rendered content into Wezboard's window across the process
boundary?

**Approach A: Reparent the WKWebView into Wezboard's window.** The Surfari
process creates the WKWebView, then the GUI reparents it into the terminal
window as a subview. macOS does not support cross-process NSView reparenting.
**Not viable.**

**Approach B: Create the WKWebView in the GUI process.** Wezboard creates the
WKWebView directly. Surfari becomes a thin control process. This breaks the
architectural principle that the engine process owns its rendering surface. It
also would not work cross-platform — on Linux there is no NSView, so the engine
must own its rendering surface. **Architecturally wrong.**

**Approach C: Extract a CAContext from WebKit's layer tree.** WebKit has an
internal layer tree. We create a `CAContext` from the root layer and export the
`contextId` to Wezboard, just like Chromium. This requires a small modification
to WebKit (~20 lines in `LayerHostingContext.mm` or similar). **Architecturally
consistent with Roamium.** Same CALayerHost pattern, same process model, same
Wezboard code path. Requires building WebKit from source (which we already need
for the reasons above).

**Approach D: Off-screen rendering.** Render into a bitmap and send pixels. This
is the CEF approach we already rejected for performance. **Not viable.**

Approach C is the recommended path. It keeps the architecture uniform across all
engines and reuses the existing Wezboard compositing code.

### Multi-profile

WebKit supports multiple profiles in one process via `WKWebsiteDataStore`.
However, TermSurf uses one-process-per-profile for architectural uniformity
across all engines (Chromium requires it; Gecko and Ladybird require it).
Surfari will follow the same model.

```objc
WKWebsiteDataStore *store = [WKWebsiteDataStore
    dataStoreForIdentifier:[[NSUUID alloc] init]];
config.websiteDataStore = store;
```

### Input handling

If using Approach C (separate process), input events are forwarded over the Unix
socket just like Roamium. WebKit's `WebPageProxy` has methods for injecting
events: `handleMouseEvent`, `handleWheelEvent`, `handleKeyboardEvent`.

### DevTools

WebKit uses Web Inspector, not Chrome DevTools. With a source build, we have
full access to the inspector APIs without private API hacks:

```objc
[webView._inspector show];
[webView._inspector attachRight];
```

### Prior work from ts1

Issue 108 documented a full WKWebView integration in TermSurf 1.x including:
navigation delegates, download handling, console capture via JS injection,
profile isolation, DevTools, HTTP auth, dialogs, file uploads, and crash
recovery. Much of this code can inform Surfari's implementation.

### What needs to happen

1. Build WebKit from source on macOS (research build system, dependencies)
2. Determine the exact compositing approach — find where in WebKit's source to
   extract a CAContext ID (Approach C)
3. Create `libtermsurf_webkit` (C library with `ts_*` API)
4. Create the Surfari Rust binary (fork from Roamium, adapt)
5. Update Wezboard to launch Surfari processes for WebKit profiles
6. Update the `web` TUI to support `--browser webkit` (or similar)
7. Test with all existing protocol messages
