# Issue 814: Ghostboard Launch and Browser Discovery Workflow

## Goal

Harden Ghostboard launch, socket discovery, debug-vs-installed binary selection,
and named/default browser startup.

## Background

Issue 810 classified this as a `Highly likely` workflow gap. The audit found
risk around named/default browser launch, installed-vs-debug binary selection,
socket discovery, app identity, and config paths. In particular, current
Ghostboard evidence indicated absolute browser paths can spawn, while named
browser launch such as default `roamium` is incomplete.

## Analysis

This issue should make the ordinary developer and app launch paths explicit and
reliable. The expected behavior should be documented before fixes so tests can
distinguish debug binaries, installed binaries, default browser names, and
explicit absolute browser paths.

Verification should include:

- debug Ghostboard can launch debug Roamium through an explicit path;
- default or named `roamium` resolves correctly where supported;
- webtui discovers `TERMSURF_SOCKET` under normal app launch;
- stale installed binaries are not accidentally used during debug testing;
- failure messages are clear when a browser cannot be resolved.

## Experiments

- [Experiment 1: Resolve named Roamium for debug launch](01-resolve-named-roamium-debug-launch.md)
