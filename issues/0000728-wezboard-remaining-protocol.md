# Issue 728: Complete remaining TermSurf protocol in Wezboard

## Goal

Implement the remaining unhandled TermSurf protocol messages in Wezboard so that
the `web` TUI works identically whether connected to Ghostboard or Wezboard.

## Background

Issues 715–727 built Wezboard from scratch — fork, rename, build cleanup, socket
server, protocol scaffolding, state management, process spawning, message
forwarding, CALayerHost rendering, overlay positioning, overlay lifecycle,
per-window overlays, and pane borders. Wezboard now handles 14 of 30 TermSurf
protocol messages (47%).

### What works

The full browser overlay pipeline is functional:

- **Socket server** (Issue 715) — Listens on
  `$TMPDIR/termsurf/wezboard-{pid}.sock`, sets `TERMSURF_SOCKET`, detects
  connection type (TUI vs Chromium), parses length-prefixed protobuf.
- **State management** (Issue 724) — Pane registry, server registry, tab-to-pane
  mappings, last-browser-pane tracking, server pane counting.
- **Process spawning** (Issue 724) — Spawns Roamium with `--ipc-socket`, tracks
  process lifecycle, reuses servers for same profile.
- **Tab lifecycle** (Issues 724, 726) — CreateTab, TabReady, CloseTab with
  proper cleanup on TUI disconnect.
- **Message forwarding** (Issue 724) — Navigate, UrlChanged, LoadingState,
  TitleChanged, SetColorScheme, ModeChanged, Resize.
- **CALayerHost rendering** (Issues 724, 725) — Transparent overlay NSView with
  layer-hosting, three-layer hierarchy (flipped → positioning → host), zero-copy
  GPU compositing.
- **Overlay positioning** (Issues 725–727) — Cell metrics bridge, per-pane grid
  offset from mux PositionedPane, contentsScale fix for Retina, TUI viewport
  offset (col/row), padding + border metrics, per-window overlay views.
- **Overlay lifecycle** (Issue 726) — Tab switching visibility sync, resize with
  Chromium Resize messages.
- **Query handlers** (Issue 726) — QueryLastRequest, QueryDevtoolsRequest,
  QueryTabsRequest with proper replies.
- **Pane borders** (Issue 723) — Configurable focused/unfocused colors, width,
  content inset.

### Messages NOT handled (16 of 30)

**Reply-only messages (6) — sent by the board, never received:**

These are outbound-only messages that the board sends in response to requests or
as state updates. The board never receives them. They are already "handled" in
the sense that their send paths exist (e.g., `HelloReply` is sent in response to
`HelloRequest`). No additional handler code is needed:

| Message            | Direction     | Status       |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| HelloReply         | Board → TUI   | Already sent |
| QueryLastReply     | Board → TUI   | Already sent |
| QueryDevtoolsReply | Board → TUI   | Already sent |
| QueryTabsReply     | Board → TUI   | Already sent |
| CreateTab          | Board → Chrom | Already sent |
| CloseTab           | Board → Chrom | Already sent |

**Board-initiated messages (4) — board generates and sends, never receives:**

These are messages the board originates in response to user input events or
window state changes. The board never receives them on the socket — it creates
and sends them. They require hooking into WezTerm's event system:

| Message     | Direction        | What it does                       |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| KeyEvent    | Board → Chromium | Forward keyboard events to browser |
| MouseEvent  | Board → Chromium | Forward mouse clicks to browser    |
| MouseMove   | Board → Chromium | Forward mouse movement to browser  |
| ScrollEvent | Board → Chromium | Forward scroll wheel to browser    |

**Received but unhandled (6) — arrive on socket, currently ignored:**

| Message            | Direction        | What it does                           |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| SetDevtoolsOverlay | TUI → Board      | Create DevTools pane linked to tab     |
| OpenSplit          | TUI → Board      | Create a split pane in the terminal    |
| CursorChanged      | Chromium → Board | Update system cursor over overlay      |
| FocusChanged       | Board → Chromium | Notify browser of focus change         |
| Resize             | Board → Chromium | Already partially handled (SetOverlay) |
| CreateDevtoolsTab  | Board → Chromium | Send DevTools tab creation to Chromium |

## Approach

Group the remaining work into experiments by functional area, ordered by user
impact:

1. **Input forwarding** — KeyEvent, MouseEvent, MouseMove, ScrollEvent. This is
   the highest-impact missing feature. Without input, the browser overlay is
   view-only. Ghostboard hooks into Surface.keyCallback() and
   mouseButtonCallback() to intercept events when in browse mode. Wezboard needs
   equivalent hooks in the WezTerm event path, translating WezTerm key/mouse
   events into TermSurf proto messages and sending them to Chromium via the
   server's tx channel.

2. **Cursor changes** — CursorChanged. When the browser changes the cursor
   (pointer, text, hand, etc.), the board should update the system cursor.
   Ghostboard handles this in `handleCursorChanged`. The proto sends a cursor
   type integer that maps to macOS NSCursor types.

3. **Focus management** — FocusChanged. When a pane gains or loses focus, the
   board should notify Chromium so it can update its internal focus state
   (affects text selection, form focus, etc.). Ghostboard sends FocusChanged
   when the active pane changes.

4. **DevTools support** — SetDevtoolsOverlay and CreateDevtoolsTab. The TUI
   sends SetDevtoolsOverlay to open DevTools for a specific tab. The board
   creates a pane with `inspected_tab_id` set, then sends CreateDevtoolsTab to
   Chromium instead of CreateTab. Ghostboard implements this in
   `handleSetDevtoolsOverlay`.

5. **Split management** — OpenSplit. The TUI sends OpenSplit to create a new
   terminal split pane. The board should call WezTerm's split pane API to create
   a new pane in the specified direction.

## Reference: Ghostboard implementations

### Input forwarding (Ghostboard)

Ghostboard routes input in `Surface.zig`:

- `keyCallback()` — In browse mode, converts key events to TermSurf KeyEvent
  proto and sends via socket. Maps Ghostty key codes to Windows virtual key
  codes. Handles Cmd+key bypass (Cmd+C/V/A/L pass to the TUI, not the browser).
- `mouseButtonCallback()` — Converts mouse events to TermSurf MouseEvent proto.
  Computes overlay-relative coordinates from window-absolute position.
- `mouseMotion()` — Sends MouseMove with overlay-relative coords.
- `scrollCallback()` — Sends ScrollEvent with delta values and phase info.

### Modifier translation

WezTerm and TermSurf use different modifier bit positions:

| Modifier | WezTerm  | TermSurf |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Shift    | `1 << 1` | `1 << 0` |
| Ctrl     | `1 << 3` | `1 << 1` |
| Alt      | `1 << 2` | `1 << 2` |
| Super    | `1 << 4` | `1 << 3` |

### Key code translation

Ghostboard maps its internal key codes to Windows virtual key codes (VK\_\*) for
the TermSurf KeyEvent proto. WezTerm uses its own `KeyCode` enum. The mapping
needs to convert WezTerm KeyCode variants to Windows VK codes.

### Cursor type mapping

The CursorChanged proto sends an integer cursor type. Ghostboard maps these to
Ghostty cursor shapes in `handleCursorChanged`. Wezboard needs to map them to
WezTerm's `MouseCursor` enum or directly to macOS NSCursor types.

## Experiment 1: Mode-aware input forwarding

### Goal

Forward keyboard, mouse, and scroll events to Chromium when the active pane is
in browse mode. This is the highest-impact missing feature — without it, the
browser overlay is view-only.

### Design

#### How Ghostboard does it

Ghostboard intercepts input at three points in `Surface.zig`:

1. **`keyCallback()` (line 2723)** — Checks `xpc.isOverlayForwarding(self)`
   (browse mode + focused pane). If true, sends `KeyEvent` to Chromium and
   returns `.consumed`. Special-cases Esc to exit browse mode.
2. **`mouseButtonCallback()` (line 4021)** — Calls `hitTestOverlay()` to check
   if the click is inside the overlay rectangle. If yes, forwards `MouseEvent`.
   Left-click on overlay auto-switches to browse mode; left-click off overlay
   switches to control mode.
3. **`scrollCallback()` (line 3519)** — Calls `hitTestOverlay()`. If the cursor
   is over the overlay, forwards `ScrollEvent` regardless of mode.

Mouse move is sent from `cursorPosCallback()` when the cursor is over the
overlay.

Coordinates are overlay-relative: `hitTestOverlay()` computes the overlay's
pixel rectangle from cell grid position, subtracts the origin, and divides by
content scale for Retina.

#### Wezboard interception points

WezTerm's event flow in `termwindow/`:

- **Keyboard**: `raw_key_event_impl()` and `key_event_impl()` both call
  `process_key()` (keyevent.rs:239). This is the single chokepoint for all
  keyboard input.
- **Mouse**: `mouse_event_impl()` (mouseevent.rs:61) dispatches to
  `mouse_event_terminal()` (mouseevent.rs:648) for pane-targeted events.
- **Scroll**: Handled as `WMEK::VertWheel` / `WMEK::HorzWheel` variants inside
  `mouse_event_terminal()`.

The active pane is available as `pane.pane_id()` (a `usize`). TermSurf state
uses string pane IDs. The bridge is `pane_id.to_string()` to look up
`state.panes`.

#### What to build

**1. Helper module: `termsurf/input.rs`** (new file)

Public functions callable from `termwindow/` that check TermSurf state and
forward to Chromium:

```rust
/// Check if a pane is in browse mode and has an active browser tab.
pub fn is_browsing(pane_id: usize) -> bool

/// Forward a key event to Chromium. Returns true if consumed.
pub fn forward_key_event(
    pane_id: usize,
    key: &KeyCode,
    modifiers: Modifiers,
    is_down: bool,
    utf8: &str,
) -> bool

/// Forward a mouse event to Chromium. Returns true if consumed.
pub fn forward_mouse_event(
    pane_id: usize,
    event_type: &str,     // "down" or "up"
    button: &str,         // "left", "right", "middle"
    x: f64,               // overlay-relative pixel X
    y: f64,               // overlay-relative pixel Y
    click_count: i64,
    modifiers: Modifiers,
) -> bool

/// Forward a mouse move to Chromium. Returns true if consumed.
pub fn forward_mouse_move(
    pane_id: usize,
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
    left_button_down: bool,
    right_button_down: bool,
) -> bool

/// Forward a scroll event to Chromium. Returns true if consumed.
pub fn forward_scroll_event(
    pane_id: usize,
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
    delta_x: f64,
    delta_y: f64,
) -> bool
```

Each function: lock TermSurf global state → look up pane by
`pane_id.to_string()` → check `pane.browsing` (for key events) or overlay bounds
(for mouse/scroll) → build protobuf message → send via server tx channel.

**2. Key code translation: `keycode_to_windows_vk()`**

Map WezTerm `KeyCode` variants to Windows virtual key codes, matching
Ghostboard's `keyToWindowsVK()` (xpc.zig:1315):

```rust
fn keycode_to_windows_vk(key: &KeyCode) -> i64 {
    match key {
        KeyCode::Char(c) => match c.to_ascii_uppercase() {
            'A'..='Z' => *c as i64,  // 0x41-0x5A
            '0'..='9' => *c as i64,  // 0x30-0x39
            _ => 0,
        },
        KeyCode::Function(n) => 0x70 + (*n as i64 - 1),  // F1=0x70
        KeyCode::Enter => 0x0D,
        KeyCode::Tab => 0x09,
        KeyCode::Backspace => 0x08,
        KeyCode::Escape => 0x1B,
        KeyCode::Delete => 0x2E,
        KeyCode::UpArrow => 0x26,
        KeyCode::DownArrow => 0x28,
        KeyCode::LeftArrow => 0x25,
        KeyCode::RightArrow => 0x27,
        KeyCode::Home => 0x24,
        KeyCode::End => 0x23,
        KeyCode::PageUp => 0x21,
        KeyCode::PageDown => 0x22,
        KeyCode::Insert => 0x2D,
        _ => 0,
    }
}
```

**3. Modifier translation: `modifiers_to_termsurf()`**

WezTerm and TermSurf use different bit positions:

```rust
fn modifiers_to_termsurf(mods: Modifiers) -> u64 {
    let mut result: u64 = 0;
    if mods.contains(Modifiers::SHIFT)   { result |= 1; }      // 1 << 0
    if mods.contains(Modifiers::CTRL)    { result |= 2; }      // 1 << 1
    if mods.contains(Modifiers::ALT)     { result |= 4; }      // 1 << 2
    if mods.contains(Modifiers::SUPER)   { result |= 8; }      // 1 << 3
    result
}
```

**4. Overlay hit testing: `hit_test_overlay()`**

Compute whether a pixel coordinate falls inside the overlay rectangle, and
return overlay-relative coordinates if so. Uses pane state (`col`, `row`,
`pixel_width`, `pixel_height`) and the cell metrics bridge:

```rust
fn hit_test_overlay(
    pane_id: usize,
    window_x: f64,
    window_y: f64,
) -> Option<(f64, f64)>
```

The overlay's pixel origin is `(col * cell_width, row * cell_height)` plus
padding and border offsets. This mirrors Ghostboard's `hitTestOverlay()`
(Surface.zig:2455).

**5. Keyboard interception in `process_key()`**

Add an early check at the top of `process_key()` (keyevent.rs:239), before
leader key and keybinding processing:

```rust
// Forward to browser overlay if in browse mode (TermSurf).
if let Some(result) = crate::termsurf::input::try_forward_key(
    pane.pane_id(),
    keycode,
    raw_modifiers,
    is_down,
    key_event,
) {
    return result;
}
```

The `try_forward_key` function handles:

- Look up TermSurf pane state for `pane.pane_id()`
- If not browsing, return `None` (let WezTerm handle normally)
- If Esc press: set `pane.browsing = false`, send `ModeChanged(false)` to TUI,
  send `FocusChanged(false)` to Chromium, return `Some(true)` (consumed)
- Otherwise: translate key code and modifiers, send `KeyEvent` to Chromium,
  return `Some(true)` (consumed)

**6. Mouse interception in `mouse_event_terminal()`**

Add an early check at the top of `mouse_event_terminal()` (mouseevent.rs:648),
before pane resolution:

```rust
// Forward to browser overlay if click hits overlay (TermSurf).
if crate::termsurf::input::try_forward_mouse(
    pane.pane_id(),
    &event,
    &self.render_metrics,
    // pass padding/border offsets for coordinate translation
) {
    return;
}
```

The `try_forward_mouse` function handles:

- Hit test: is the mouse position inside the overlay rectangle?
- If yes and left-click press: auto-switch to browse mode (set
  `pane.browsing = true`, send `ModeChanged(true)` to TUI)
- If yes: forward `MouseEvent`, `MouseMove`, or `ScrollEvent` depending on
  `event.kind`
- If no and left-click press and was browsing: switch to control mode
- Mouse move forwarding when cursor is over overlay (regardless of browse mode,
  for hover effects)

**7. Mode change notifications**

When the board auto-switches mode (click on/off overlay, Esc), it must notify
both sides:

- **TUI**: Send `ModeChanged { browsing, pane_id }` so the TUI updates its
  status bar
- **Chromium**: Send `FocusChanged { tab_id, focused }` so Chromium updates
  internal focus state (text selection, form focus, etc.)

This requires a new helper in `conn.rs`:

```rust
pub fn send_mode_changed(pane_id: &str, browsing: bool, state: &SharedState)
pub fn send_focus_changed(pane_id: &str, focused: bool, state: &SharedState)
```

| `termwindow/mouseevent.rs` | Early return in `mouse_event_terminal()`      |

### Coordinate system

The trickiest part is translating mouse coordinates from WezTerm's window pixel
space to overlay-relative pixel space:

1. **Window pixel coords** — `event.coords.x`, `event.coords.y` (from
   `mouse_event_impl`)
2. **Subtract padding + border + tab bar** — same offsets already computed in
   `mouse_event_impl()` for cell coordinate conversion
3. **Subtract overlay origin** — `col * cell_width`, `row * cell_height` (from
   TermSurf pane state × cell metrics)
4. **Divide by content scale** — for Retina displays (matches Ghostboard's
   approach)

Cell metrics are available via the global atomics bridge (`termsurf::metrics`),
already used for overlay positioning in Issue 725.

### Verification

1. `cd wezboard && cargo build -p wezboard-gui` — zero errors
2. Open `web google.com` — overlay renders (existing behavior)
3. Type in the Google search box — keystrokes appear in the browser
4. Click a link — navigates to the target page
5. Scroll on a page — page scrolls
6. Press Esc — returns to control mode, keys go to terminal
7. Click on overlay — auto-switches to browse mode
8. Click outside overlay — returns to control mode

**Result:** Fail

Build succeeded with zero errors and keyboard input partially worked — key
events reached Chromium and the browser responded to them. However, mouse input
had two critical bugs:

1. **Mouse coordinates were wrong.** Hovered links highlighted significantly
   lower than the actual cursor position. The `hit_test_overlay` function stored
   the overlay origin in backing pixels (pre-Retina-scale values from
   `update_ca_layer_frame`) and compared them correctly against `event.coords`
   (also backing pixels), so hit testing worked. But the overlay-relative
   coordinates sent to Chromium were in backing pixels, while Chromium expects
   logical/CSS pixels (points). On a 2× Retina display, the y offset sent to
   Chromium was double the correct value, making hovers land far below the
   cursor.

2. **Scroll events crashed Chromium.** WezTerm's `WMEK::VertWheel(i16)` is a
   discrete wheel delta with no scroll phase information. The implementation
   sent `phase=0` and `momentum_phase=0`, but Chromium's
   `MouseWheelEventQueue::TryForwardNextEventToRenderer()` has a DCHECK
   requiring at least one of phase or momentum_phase to be non-zero
   (`kPhaseNone = 0` is invalid for both). Ghostboard avoids this because it
   passes through the raw macOS `NSEvent.phase` and `NSEvent.momentumPhase`
   values directly from the Swift layer — discrete trackpad scrolls always have
   a real phase. WezTerm's event model strips this information.

#### Conclusion

The architecture is sound — the module structure, interception points, key
translation, modifier remapping, and mode toggling all worked correctly. The two
failures are coordinate-space and protocol-detail bugs:

- **Fix 1: Divide by scale.** Store the Retina scale factor in pane state
  (already available in `update_ca_layer_frame` as the `scale` variable). In
  `hit_test_overlay`, divide the overlay-relative coordinates by scale before
  returning them. This converts backing pixels → logical pixels for Chromium.

- **Fix 2: Set scroll phase.** For discrete wheel events, set `phase = 4`
  (`kPhaseChanged`, which is `1 << 2` in Chromium's bit-flag enum) instead of 0.
  This satisfies the DCHECK. Ghostboard doesn't need this because it forwards
  raw macOS phases, but Wezboard must synthesize them since WezTerm doesn't
  expose scroll phases.

### Experiment 2: Fix coordinate scale and scroll phase

#### Goal

Fix the two bugs from Experiment 1 so that mouse hover/click coordinates match
the cursor position and scroll events don't crash Chromium.

#### Changes

**1. Add `overlay_scale` to pane state (`state.rs`)**

Add one field to `Pane`:

```rust
pub overlay_scale: f64,
```

Initialize to `1.0` in the `SetOverlay` handler where panes are created.

**2. Store scale in `update_ca_layer_frame` (`conn.rs`)**

After the existing `pane.overlay_origin_y = y_backing;` line, add:

```rust
pane.overlay_scale = scale;
```

The `scale` variable is already computed on the line above
(`let scale: f64 = msg_send![root_layer, contentsScale]`). This is the Retina
backing scale factor (2.0 on Retina, 1.0 on non-Retina).

**3. Divide by scale in `hit_test_overlay` (`input.rs`)**

The hit test itself is correct — both `event.coords` and `overlay_origin` are in
backing pixels, so the comparison works. But the returned overlay-relative
coordinates must be divided by scale before being sent to Chromium, which
expects logical/CSS pixels.

Change the return from:

```rust
Some((mx - ox, my - oy))
```

to:

```rust
let scale = pane.overlay_scale;
Some(((mx - ox) / scale, (my - oy) / scale))
```

**4. Set scroll phase to `kPhaseChanged` (`input.rs`)**

In the `WMEK::VertWheel` handler, change `phase: 0` to `phase: 4`.

The value 4 is `kPhaseChanged` (`1 << 2`) in Chromium's
`WebMouseWheelEvent::Phase` bit-flag enum. This satisfies the DCHECK that
requires at least one of phase or momentum_phase to be non-zero. Setting
`kPhaseChanged` is semantically correct for a discrete scroll tick — the scroll
is actively changing.

#### Verification

1. `cd wezboard && cargo build -p wezboard-gui` — zero errors
2. Open `web google.com` — overlay renders
3. Move mouse over a link — link highlights directly under the cursor (not
   offset)
4. Click a link — navigates to the correct target
5. Scroll on a page — page scrolls without crashing Chromium
6. Type in the search box — keystrokes appear (regression check)
7. Press Esc — returns to control mode (regression check)

**Result:** Success

Both bugs from Experiment 1 are fixed:

1. **Coordinate scale** — Storing `overlay_scale` in pane state and dividing
   overlay-relative coordinates by scale in `hit_test_overlay` converts backing
   pixels to logical/CSS pixels. Mouse hover and click now land directly under
   the cursor on Retina displays.

2. **Scroll phase** — Setting `phase: 4` (`kPhaseChanged`) for discrete wheel
   events satisfies Chromium's DCHECK. Scrolling works without crashes.

All regression checks pass: keyboard input, Esc to exit browse mode, click to
enter browse mode, click outside to exit.

### Experiment 3: Fix Esc key not exiting browse mode

#### Goal

Make the Esc key exit browse mode. Currently, pressing Esc while in browse mode
does nothing — the user is stuck in browse mode with no keyboard escape.

#### Root cause

WezTerm's key event pipeline fires two events per keypress: `RawKeyEvent` first,
then `KeyEvent`. The raw event carries `KeyCode::Physical(Escape)`, the decoded
event carries `KeyCode::Char('\u{1b}')`.

The problem:

1. `raw_key_event_impl` calls `process_key` with `KeyCode::Physical(Escape)`
2. `process_key` runs the TermSurf check first — `try_forward_key` sees the pane
   is browsing, doesn't recognize `Physical(Escape)` as Esc (it only checks
   `Char('\u{1b}')`), so it falls through to the "forward key to Chromium" path
3. It sends a useless `KeyEvent` proto with `windows_key_code: 0` to Chromium
   and returns `Some(true)` (consumed)
4. `process_key` returns `true` → `key.set_handled()` is called
5. Back in `window.rs:2754`: the windowing layer sees `raw_key_handled` is set
   and **returns early, never dispatching the decoded `KeyEvent`**
6. `key_event_impl` never runs, so the `Char('\u{1b}')` path that would match
   the Esc check never fires

This affects ALL keys in browse mode — every key gets forwarded twice (once from
the raw path with a garbage keycode, once from the decoded path with the correct
keycode). But Esc is the only key where the double-forward causes a functional
bug, because the Esc exit check only matches the decoded form.

#### Design

Skip the TermSurf intercept during the raw key event path. Only intercept during
the decoded key event path where we have proper `KeyCode::Char(...)` values.

**Option A: Pass `only_key_bindings` to `try_forward_key`**

Add a parameter to `try_forward_key` and return `None` (don't intercept) when
`only_key_bindings` is true. The raw path always passes `OnlyKeyBindings::Yes`,
the decoded path passes `OnlyKeyBindings::No`.

This is clean because it means TermSurf only intercepts once per keypress (the
decoded path), and the keycode is always in the `Char(...)` form that
`keycode_to_windows_vk` can translate. It also eliminates the duplicate
forwarding bug.

**Option B: Match `Physical(Escape)` in the Esc check**

Add `KeyCode::Physical(PhysKeyCode::Escape)` to the Esc detection pattern. This
fixes the Esc bug but doesn't fix the double-forwarding problem — every key
still gets sent to Chromium twice (once with garbage from the raw path).

**Decision: Option A.** It fixes both the Esc bug and the double-forwarding
problem with a single change.

#### Changes

**1. `termsurf/input.rs` — Add `only_key_bindings: bool` parameter**

Change the `try_forward_key` signature to add a boolean parameter. At the top of
the function, before the state lookup, return `None` if `only_key_bindings` is
true:

```rust
pub fn try_forward_key(
    pane_id: usize,
    keycode: &KeyCode,
    modifiers: Modifiers,
    is_down: bool,
    key_event: Option<&::window::KeyEvent>,
    only_key_bindings: bool,
) -> Option<bool> {
    if only_key_bindings {
        return None;
    }
    // ... rest unchanged
}
```

**2. `termwindow/keyevent.rs` — Pass `only_key_bindings` at call site**

In `process_key` (line 252), pass the `only_key_bindings` parameter:

```rust
if let Some(result) = crate::termsurf::input::try_forward_key(
    pane.pane_id(),
    keycode,
    raw_modifiers,
    is_down,
    key_event,
    only_key_bindings == OnlyKeyBindings::Yes,
) {
    return result;
}
```

#### Verification

1. `cd wezboard && cargo build -p wezboard-gui` — zero errors
2. Click on overlay — enters browse mode
3. Press Esc — exits browse mode, keys go to terminal
4. Type in browser while in browse mode — keystrokes appear (regression check)
5. Click a link — navigates correctly (regression check)
6. Scroll — page scrolls (regression check)

**Result:** Success

Esc now exits browse mode. Skipping the TermSurf intercept during the raw key
path (`OnlyKeyBindings::Yes`) ensures the raw `KeyCode::Physical(Escape)` event
passes through without being consumed, allowing the decoded
`KeyCode::Char('\u{1b}')` event to fire and match the Esc check. This also
eliminates the double-forwarding bug where every key was sent to Chromium twice
(once from the raw path with a garbage keycode, once from the decoded path with
the correct keycode). All regression checks pass.

### Experiment 4: CursorChanged — update system cursor over overlay

#### Goal

When Chromium sends `CursorChanged` (e.g., hand cursor over a link, text cursor
over an input field), update the system cursor. Currently the cursor stays as an
arrow over the overlay because `mouse_event_terminal` returns early when
`try_forward_mouse` returns true, never reaching WezTerm's `set_cursor` call.

#### Design

Three changes:

1. **Store cursor type in pane state.** Add `cursor_type: i64` to `Pane` struct
   (default 0 = arrow). The `CursorChanged` handler in `conn.rs` updates this
   field when Chromium sends the message.

2. **Handle CursorChanged in conn.rs.** Add a match arm in `handle_message` that
   looks up the pane by `tab_id` and stores the `cursor_type`. No forwarding
   needed — this message is consumed by the board.

3. **Apply cursor after try_forward_mouse.** In `mouseevent.rs`, after
   `try_forward_mouse` returns true, read the pane's `cursor_type` from state
   and call `context.set_cursor()` with the mapped `MouseCursor` value before
   returning.

Add a public helper `cursor_for_pane(pane_id: usize) -> MouseCursor` in
`input.rs` that reads the stored cursor type and maps Chromium's integer cursor
types to WezTerm's `MouseCursor` enum.

Chromium cursor type mapping (from Ghostboard's `mapChromiumCursor`):

| Chromium type | Name         | MouseCursor  |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| 0             | kPointer     | Arrow        |
| 2             | kHand        | Hand         |
| 3             | kIBeam       | Text         |
| all others    | —            | Arrow        |

WezTerm only has Arrow, Hand, Text, SizeUpDown, and SizeLeftRight. All
unsupported Chromium cursor types fall back to Arrow.

#### Changes

**1. `termsurf/state.rs` — Add `cursor_type` field to `Pane`**

```rust
pub overlay_scale: f64,
pub cursor_type: i64,
```

Initialize to `0` wherever panes are created.

**2. `termsurf/conn.rs` — Handle CursorChanged message**

Add to `msg_type_name`:
```rust
Some(Msg::CursorChanged(_)) => "CursorChanged",
```

Add to `handle_message`:
```rust
Some(Msg::CursorChanged(c)) => {
    log::info!("CursorChanged: tab_id={} cursor_type={}", c.tab_id, c.cursor_type);
    let mut st = state.lock().unwrap();
    if let Some(pane_id) = st.tab_to_pane.get(&c.tab_id).cloned() {
        if let Some(pane) = st.panes.get_mut(&pane_id) {
            pane.cursor_type = c.cursor_type;
        }
    }
}
```

**3. `termsurf/input.rs` — Add `cursor_for_pane` helper**

```rust
pub fn cursor_for_pane(pane_id: usize) -> MouseCursor {
    let pane_id_str = pane_id.to_string();
    let Some(state) = super::shared_state() else {
        return MouseCursor::Arrow;
    };
    let st = state.lock().unwrap();
    let Some(pane) = st.panes.get(&pane_id_str) else {
        return MouseCursor::Arrow;
    };
    match pane.cursor_type {
        2 => MouseCursor::Hand,
        3 => MouseCursor::Text,
        _ => MouseCursor::Arrow,
    }
}
```

**4. `termwindow/mouseevent.rs` — Apply cursor after forward**

```rust
if crate::termsurf::input::try_forward_mouse(pane.pane_id(), &event) {
    context.set_cursor(Some(
        crate::termsurf::input::cursor_for_pane(pane.pane_id()),
    ));
    return;
}
```

#### Verification

1. `cd wezboard && cargo build -p wezboard-gui` — zero errors
2. Hover over a link — cursor changes to hand
3. Hover over text input — cursor changes to text beam
4. Hover over non-interactive area — cursor is arrow
5. Move cursor off overlay — cursor reverts to normal terminal cursor
6. Click, type, scroll — still work (regression check)

**Result:** Success

System cursor now updates over the browser overlay. Chromium sends
`CursorChanged` messages with integer cursor types, stored in pane state. After
`try_forward_mouse` returns true, the cursor is applied via `cursor_for_pane`
which maps Chromium types to WezTerm's `MouseCursor` enum (hand for links, text
beam for inputs, arrow for everything else). All regression checks pass.

### Experiment 5: FocusChanged on pane switch

#### Goal

When the user switches between terminal panes (click, Ctrl+Shift+Arrow), send
`FocusChanged(false)` to the old pane's Chromium and `FocusChanged(true)` to
the new pane's Chromium (if it's in browse mode). Without this, the browser in
an unfocused pane keeps its focus state — text cursors blink in form fields,
selection highlights persist, etc.

#### Design

WezTerm's mux fires `MuxNotification::PaneFocused(pane_id)` whenever the active
pane changes (tab.rs:1782). Wezboard already handles this notification in
`mod.rs:1327` but only calls `update_title_post_status()`. Add a TermSurf hook
here.

The hook needs to:

1. Find the previously focused TermSurf pane (if any) and send
   `FocusChanged(false)` to its Chromium
2. Check if the newly focused pane is a TermSurf pane in browse mode — if so,
   send `FocusChanged(true)` to its Chromium
3. Update `focused_pane` in TermSurf state to track the current focus

The `focused_pane` field already exists in `TermSurfState` (state.rs:49) but is
never written. This experiment puts it to use.

#### Changes

**1. `termsurf/input.rs` — Add `handle_pane_focus` public function**

```rust
pub fn handle_pane_focus(pane_id: usize) {
    let pane_id_str = pane_id.to_string();
    let Some(state) = super::shared_state() else {
        return;
    };

    let (old_pane, new_is_browsing) = {
        let mut st = state.lock().unwrap();
        let old = st.focused_pane.take();
        let new_is_browsing = st
            .panes
            .get(&pane_id_str)
            .map(|p| p.browsing)
            .unwrap_or(false);
        st.focused_pane = Some(pane_id_str.clone());
        (old, new_is_browsing)
    };

    // Unfocus old pane's Chromium
    if let Some(ref old_id) = old_pane {
        if *old_id != pane_id_str {
            send_to_chromium(
                old_id,
                Msg::FocusChanged(proto::FocusChanged {
                    tab_id: 0,
                    focused: false,
                }),
            );
        }
    }

    // Focus new pane's Chromium if browsing
    if new_is_browsing {
        send_to_chromium(
            &pane_id_str,
            Msg::FocusChanged(proto::FocusChanged {
                tab_id: 0,
                focused: true,
            }),
        );
    }
}
```

**2. `termwindow/mod.rs` — Call hook from PaneFocused handler**

```rust
MuxNotification::PaneFocused(pane_id) => {
    crate::termsurf::input::handle_pane_focus(*pane_id);
    self.update_title_post_status();
}
```

#### Verification

1. `cd wezboard && cargo build -p wezboard-gui` — zero errors
2. Open two split panes, each with a browser overlay
3. Click on pane A's overlay (enters browse mode), click a text field
4. Click on pane B — text cursor in pane A's browser should stop blinking
5. Click on pane A's overlay again — text cursor resumes
6. Use Ctrl+Shift+Arrow to switch panes — same focus behavior
7. Single pane with no splits — still works normally (regression check)

**Result:** Success

Pane focus changes now notify Chromium. The `MuxNotification::PaneFocused`
handler calls `handle_pane_focus`, which tracks the previously focused pane in
`TermSurfState.focused_pane` and sends `FocusChanged(false)` to the old pane's
Chromium and `FocusChanged(true)` to the new pane's Chromium (if browsing).
Text cursors stop blinking and selections deactivate when switching away from a
pane. All regression checks pass.
