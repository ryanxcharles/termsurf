# Experiment 8: VT OSC subsection — TermSurf rebrand + fork verification (Phase 1)

## Description

The fourth and heaviest VT verification pass: the **OSC** subsection (15 pages,
**10 with product/behavior claims** — the design review found `osc/8` also has
behavioral claims). Same method as Concepts/Control — verify each claim against
the Ghostboard fork **by tracing to the consumer, not just the parser**, rebrand
confirmed claims, correct/soften genuinely stale ones, then move all 15 OSC
pages to the importer's `VERIFIED` set. The 5 claim-free OSC pages (`4`, `5`,
`104`, `105`, `7` — `7` was the Exp-3 slice) are verified-by-absence like
CSI/ESC.

> **Critical lesson from the design review (verify the consumer, not the
> parser):** the first draft assumed `osc/1x`'s "only 10-12" and `osc/11x`'s
> "only 110-112" were stale because the OSC parser _routes_ 10-19/110-119 to the
> color parser. But the **consumer** applies only foreground/background/cursor
> (10-12 / 110-112) and explicitly no-ops 13-19 / 113-119
> (`termio/stream_handler.zig:1254-1386`,
> `terminal/stream_terminal.zig:614-647`, all logging "not implemented"). So
> those page claims are **accurate** — and, worse, **Experiment 5
> over-claimed**: `concepts/colors.mdx` was changed to "ten dynamic colors, OSC
> 10-19", which is **false**. This experiment also **corrects that Exp-5 error**
> (see decision below). Routing/parsing ≠ application.

### Special-handling rule: version/compat tables (`osc/1`, `osc/22`)

Keep the other-terminal columns (factual comparisons), but the **Ghostty
column** states _Ghostty's_ values (`1.0.0`, `No`). Relabel that column
"TermSurf" only with a **fork-verified** value (a version where support is
confirmed, or Yes/No), never by copying Ghostty's number. If the TermSurf value
can't be verified, drop the version specificity (Yes/No) rather than assert
Ghostty's. (The OSC-1 "No" and OSC-22 "Yes" cells are fork-justified above; the
`1.0.0` _version_ is not TermSurf's and must not be copied.)

### Range claims (1x, 11x) are ACCURATE — keep, don't widen

The design review (tracing the consumer, not the parser) confirmed the fork
applies only OSC 10-12 / 110-112 and explicitly no-ops 13-19 / 113-119. So both
"only 10-12" / "only 110-112" caveats are **fork-accurate** — keep them, rebrand
Ghostty→TermSurf only.

### Correct the Experiment 5 over-claim in `colors.mdx`

This pass revealed that Exp 5's `concepts/colors.mdx` edit — "TermSurf … 10
**dynamic colors** … OSCs 10 to 19" — is **false**: the fork applies only
foreground/background/cursor (OSC 10-12); the `Dynamic` enum's 13-19 slots are
defined but **not implemented** (consumer no-ops them). `colors.mdx` is
corrected here back to the fork-accurate statement — three dynamic colors
(foreground, background, cursor), set with OSC 10-12 — matching `osc/1x`. (The
Exp-5 _experiment file_ is a historical record and is not edited; only the live
`colors.mdx` content is corrected, and this correction is documented here.)

## Changes

Files in `website/`:

1. **`src/content/docs/vt/osc/{0,1,2,8,9,1x,11x,22,52,conemu}.mdx`** (10 pages)
   — per-claim fork-verified rebrand/correction/softening per the inventory; the
   5 claim-free OSC pages (`4,5,104,105,7`) unchanged.
2. **`src/content/docs/vt/concepts/colors.mdx`** — **correct the Exp-5
   over-claim**: dynamic colors back to three (foreground/background/cursor),
   OSC 10-12 (the fork applies only those; 13-19 are defined-but-unimplemented).
3. **`scripts/import-vt.ts`** — add the 15 `osc/*` rel-paths to `VERIFIED`
   (bringing it to 61; only the 3 top-level pages remain mechanical).
   `colors.mdx` is already in `VERIFIED`.

No fork source changes; no nav/schema changes.

## Verification

1. **Every claim fork-cited.** The Result records, per claim, the fork file:line
   and disposition (confirmed/corrected/softened) — verified by tracing the
   **consumer**, not just the parser. Special: the `osc/1`+`osc/22` table cells
   reflect the fork (no copied Ghostty version); the `conemu` timeout cites the
   macOS path; `osc/1x`/`11x` keep their "only 10-12 / 110-112" caveats.
2. **No unverified TermSurf assertion.** Built OSC pages assert no
   TermSurf-specific product fact that isn't fork-confirmed; no
   `Ghostty | 1.0.0` cell relabeled TermSurf with Ghostty's number.
3. **Cross-page consistency.** `colors.mdx` and `osc/1x` now agree: three
   dynamic colors (fg/bg/cursor), OSC 10-12.
4. **Importer coherence.** `import:vt --check` exits 0 (skips 61 verified); a
   re-run leaves OSC pages intact.
5. **Builds + links.** `bun run build` 76 pages; `astro check` 0 errors; OSC
   pages render; no dead links/fragments.
6. **No regressions.** Other pages unchanged.

A full pass leaves OSC fork-verified and TermSurf-branded **and** fixes the
Exp-5 dynamic-colors error; only the 3 top-level VT pages (Exp 9) then remain
before the VT framing note can drop.

## Design Review

**Pass 1 — REJECT.** An independent `adversarial-reviewer`, tracing the fork
_consumers_ (not just the parser), found three gate-blocking disposition errors
in the first draft, all corrected above:

1. `osc/1x` "only 10-12" and `osc/11x` "only 110-112" are **fork-accurate**
   (`stream_handler.zig:1254-1386` applies only 10-12/110-112, no-ops the rest)
   — the draft wrongly called them stale and would have asserted a false
   "supports 10-19". Now: keep + rebrand only.
2. This also exposed that **Exp 5's `colors.mdx` "ten dynamic colors, OSC 10-19"
   is false** — corrected here to three (fg/bg/cursor), OSC 10-12.
3. The `conemu` "~15s timeout" is **not** GTK-only — macOS has it
   (`SurfaceView_AppKit.swift:46`), so it's fork-confirmed; the draft's
   "soften/remove" would have deleted a true claim. Now: keep + rebrand.

Confirmed-correct dispositions (reviewer): osc/0 icon→title alias
(`stream.zig:1986-1989`), osc/1 "No" (`stream.zig:1988`), osc/2 UTF-8
(`stream.zig:1977`), osc/9 ConEmu→OSC9 (`osc9.zig:186`), osc/22 CSS cursor
shapes (`mouse.zig:31`) + OSC-22 "Yes" (`stream_handler.zig:1057`); the
version-table rule is rigorous enough. Optional findings folded in: `osc/8` has
behavioral claims (added to the inventory); `osc/52`'s c/p/s/alias lives in the
consumer `stream_handler.zig:1066` and "primary" maps to the standard (`c`)
clipboard.

**Pass 2 — APPROVE WITH CHANGES.** A fresh reviewer re-verified all three
corrections against the fork (consumer no-ops 13-19/113-119 at
`stream_handler.zig:1255-1380`; `color.zig:372-382` `Dynamic` 10-19; macOS 15s
timer at `SurfaceView_AppKit.swift:46`), confirmed osc/8's claims are
fork-backed (`hyperlink.zig:40`), the osc/52 cites, and the 10+5=15 page split,
with no new errors. One trivial fix (applied): the inventory header said "(9
pages)" → now "(10 pages)". Approved to implement.

## Result

**Result:** Pass

All 10 OSC claim pages were fork-verified and rebranded/corrected per the
inventory; the 5 claim-free OSC pages and `colors.mdx` correction were applied;
all 15 OSC pages joined `VERIFIED` (now 61, leaving only the 3 top-level pages
mechanical).

### Dispositions applied

- **osc/1x, osc/11x** — kept the "only 10-12 / 110-112" caveats (fork-accurate),
  rebranded `Ghostty`→`TermSurf`.
- **colors.mdx** — corrected the Exp-5 over-claim back to **three** dynamic
  colors (foreground/background/cursor), OSC 10-12; now consistent with osc/1x.
- **osc/0** (icon unsupported → title alias), **osc/2** (UTF-8), **osc/9**
  (invalid ConEmu → OSC 9), **osc/22** (CSS cursor shapes) — confirmed,
  rebranded.
- **osc/1** — rebranded prose; compat-table column `Ghostty`→`TermSurf`, value
  "No" (fork: icon ignored, `stream.zig:1988`); other-terminal columns kept.
- **osc/22 table** — column `Ghostty`→`TermSurf`; the `1.0.0` _version_ cell →
  `Yes` (support confirmed, but TermSurf's version isn't; rule 1 forbids copying
  Ghostty's number); `Cursor styles` `CSS` kept.
- **osc/52** — rebranded; corrected "primary clipboard (equivalent to `c`)" →
  "standard clipboard (`c`)" (fork default is `c`); softened "limitation on our
  end" → "current limitation".
- **osc/conemu** — all six mentions rebranded, **including the "hardcoded ~15s
  timeout"** (macOS-confirmed, `SurfaceView_AppKit.swift:46`).
- **osc/8** — its behavioral statements ("only `id` recognized"; `file://`
  hostname requirement) name no product and were left as generic spec (no false
  TermSurf claim introduced); the `id`-only claim is fork-backed
  (`hyperlink.zig:40`).

### Verification results

1. **Claims fork-cited** — table + the consumer-traced dispositions above; the
   per-claim accuracy was independently confirmed across two design-review
   passes. **Pass.**
2. **No unverified TermSurf assertion** — grep shows no product "Ghostty" left
   in `osc/`; no `1.0.0` version copied into a TermSurf cell (escaped-dot grep:
   zero literal `1.0.0` in `osc/22`). **Pass.**
3. **Cross-page consistency** — `colors.mdx` and `osc/1x` agree (three dynamic
   colors, OSC 10-12). **Pass.**
4. **Importer coherence** — `import:vt --check` exits 0; a re-run wrote 3 pages
   (only top-level mechanical) and left all 61 verified pages intact. **Pass.**
5. **Builds + links** — `bun run build` 76 pages; `astro check` 0 errors; a
   head+body crawl of all VT pages finds **zero** dead links/fragments.
   **Pass.**
6. **No regressions** — other pages unchanged. **Pass.**

## Conclusion

OSC — the heaviest VT pass — is fork-verified and TermSurf-branded, and the
verification corrected real errors: it kept two accurate range caveats the first
draft would have wrongly widened, **fixed the Exp-5 dynamic-colors over-claim**
(ten→three), preserved the macOS-confirmed ConEmu timeout the first draft would
have deleted, and replaced Ghostty's `1.0.0` version cell with a verified `Yes`.
61 of 64 VT pages are now verified. Only the **3 top-level pages**
(index/reference/external — Exp 9) remain; after that the VT index framing note
can be removed, completing scope decision 1. Then Phase 1's remaining pieces
(search, versioning, IA, deploy) and Phases 2–4.
