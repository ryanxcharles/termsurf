# Experiment 192: Port Kitty Graphics Terminal Dispatch

## Description

Experiments 186-191 ported Kitty graphics parsing, direct image loading, image
storage, query/transmit execution, placement storage, and storage-side display
execution. The remaining gap is that this machinery is not connected to terminal
input:

- `stream.rs` emits `Action::ApcStart`, `Action::ApcPut`, and `Action::ApcEnd`;
- `terminal.rs` currently ignores all APC actions;
- `Screen` has no `ImageStorage`;
- `graphics_exec::execute(storage, command)` can execute query/transmit but has
  no terminal state for display commands;
- `graphics_exec::display_with_location(...)` can store display placements once
  terminal state supplies a location.

The next coherent slice is terminal dispatch for Kitty graphics APC sequences.
This experiment should make `ESC_G...ESC\` commands mutate the active screen's
Kitty image storage and write Kitty responses to the existing PTY response
buffer.

This is still not renderer integration. It should not expose public C ABI,
render pixels, implement deletion/animation commands, or add a macOS app
surface. It is the terminal-core bridge between already-ported Kitty graphics
storage/execution and already-ported terminal stream decoding.

## Changes

1. Add Kitty graphics storage to `Screen`.
   - Add an `ImageStorage` field to `Screen`.
   - Initialize it in `Screen::init`.
   - Reset it in `Screen::reset`.
   - Add small internal accessors for active-screen Kitty storage, for example:
     - `kitty_images(&self) -> &ImageStorage`;
     - `kitty_images_mut(&mut self) -> &mut ImageStorage`.
   - Keep the storage screen-local, matching the existing primary/alternate
     screen split. Do not attach image storage globally to `Terminal`.

2. Add APC accumulation state to `Terminal`.
   - Add a small terminal-owned Kitty graphics APC parser/buffer state.
   - On `Action::ApcStart`, reset the state to "pending first byte".
   - On the first `Action::ApcPut { byte }` after `ApcStart`, select Kitty
     graphics only if `byte == b'G'`.
   - If the first APC byte is not `G`, switch to a "drain non-Kitty APC" state
     until `ApcEnd`.
   - On subsequent `Action::ApcPut { byte }` for a selected Kitty graphics APC,
     feed payload bytes to the Kitty graphics parser after the leading `G`.
   - On `Action::ApcEnd`, complete the parser and execute the command if the APC
     was a Kitty graphics APC.
   - Non-Kitty APC sequences must remain ignored, preserving current behavior.
   - Parser errors should not panic or dirty terminal text state. Ignore parse
     errors in this experiment rather than inventing partial responses; the
     current parser returns only `Result<Command, ParseError>` and does not
     expose partial `i` / `I` / `p` / `q` fields.
   - Use a concrete terminal APC payload limit equal to the existing direct
     loading limit used by `LoadingImageLimits::DIRECT`. If the parser reports
     `ParseError::OutOfMemory`, ignore the failed APC, clear the parser state,
     and leave terminal text state unchanged.

3. Execute query and transmit through existing storage execution.
   - For `CommandControl::Query` and `CommandControl::Transmit`, call the
     existing `graphics_exec::execute(storage, command)` path against the active
     screen's storage.
   - Encode any returned `Response` with `Response::encode(...)`.
   - Append the encoded bytes through `write_pty_response_bytes(...)` so the
     existing PTY response callback path is preserved.
   - Preserve quiet-mode filtering from `graphics_exec::execute`.

4. Execute storage-side display through terminal state.
   - For `CommandControl::Display`, call
     `graphics_exec::display_with_location(...)` through a new narrowly scoped
     terminal-display wrapper that preserves the same behavior as
     `graphics_exec::execute(...)` for:
     - `ImageStorage::enabled() == false`;
     - `Quiet::Ok` success suppression;
     - `Quiet::Failures` failure suppression.
   - For non-virtual display commands, use the active cursor cell as
     `PlacementLocation::Cell { x, y }`.
   - For virtual display commands, continue to let `display_with_location(...)`
     force `PlacementLocation::Virtual`.
   - Do not fake tracked pin ownership in this experiment. The stored cell
     location is a truthful but temporary terminal-coordinate bridge; tracked
     page-pin ownership belongs in a later experiment once placement cleanup and
     renderer access can share that source of truth.

5. Preserve cursor movement scope.
   - Keep `CursorMovement::After` deferred.
   - Do not move the cursor in this experiment.
   - Do not compute placement grid size from pixel metrics in this experiment.
     `Placement::grid_size(...)` already exists, but terminal APC dispatch does
     not yet own renderer/cell pixel metrics. Cursor-after movement should be a
     later experiment that wires those metrics deliberately.

6. Preserve unsupported command behavior.
   - Keep `TransmitAndDisplay` returning the existing unimplemented response
     through `graphics_exec::execute`.
   - Do not route only the transmit half. That would store an image while
     silently dropping display semantics.
   - If implementing `TransmitAndDisplay` correctly requires combining transmit
     and terminal display in one atomic path, stop and design a later experiment
     rather than quietly expanding scope.
   - Keep delete and animation commands unimplemented.

7. Add focused terminal dispatch tests.
   - Add tests proving that:
     - non-Kitty APC is ignored;
     - malformed Kitty APC does not panic or mutate text state;
     - an over-limit Kitty APC does not panic, clears parser state, and leaves
       terminal text state unchanged;
     - query APC writes the expected Kitty response;
     - direct transmit APC stores an image on the active screen;
     - quiet transmit suppresses the success response but stores the image;
     - display APC stores a placement at the current cursor cell;
     - quiet display success and failure filtering matches query/transmit quiet
       filtering;
     - disabled image storage suppresses display mutation and responses;
     - display by image number resolves the newest matching image;
     - virtual display stores `PlacementLocation::Virtual`;
     - display with `CursorMovement::After` stores placement but leaves cursor
       position unchanged;
     - switching to the alternate screen uses separate Kitty image storage;
     - full terminal reset clears Kitty image storage.
     - reset/full reset clears any partial APC parser state.
   - Use equivalent Roastty tests when upstream tests are tied to renderer
     internals not yet ported.

## Verification

Run:

```bash
cargo fmt -- roastty/src/terminal/terminal.rs roastty/src/terminal/screen.rs roastty/src/terminal/kitty/mod.rs roastty/src/terminal/kitty/graphics_command.rs roastty/src/terminal/kitty/graphics_exec.rs roastty/src/terminal/kitty/graphics_storage.rs
cargo test -p roastty kitty_graphics_command
cargo test -p roastty kitty_graphics_exec
cargo test -p roastty kitty_graphics_storage
cargo test -p roastty terminal_stream_kitty_graphics
cargo test -p roastty
if rg -n 'ghostty|Ghostty|GHOSTTY' roastty/src/lib.rs roastty/include/roastty.h roastty/tests/abi_harness.c; then exit 1; else exit 0; fi
git diff --check
```

The experiment passes when terminal `next_slice(...)` can receive Kitty graphics
APC sequences, mutate active-screen image/placement storage for query, transmit,
and display commands, and write encoded Kitty responses through the existing PTY
response path, while leaving rendering, C ABI, tracked placement pins,
cursor-after movement, deletion, animation, and combined transmit-and-display
semantics deferred.
