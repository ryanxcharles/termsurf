# Experiment 566: the DFA UTF-8 decoder (Utf8Decoder)

## Description

This experiment ports upstream `terminal/UTF8Decoder.zig` — a DFA-based,
non-allocating, error-replacing UTF-8 decoder (Bjoern Hoehrmann's design with
error replacement). It lands at `terminal::utf8_decoder`. It is the canonical
standalone decoder upstream's terminal stream parser imports; roastty's
`terminal/stream.rs` currently has its **own, separate** length-based decoder
(`std::str::from_utf8` over a small byte buffer), so this port is independent
and non-duplicating — it faithfully mirrors upstream's source file without
touching `stream.rs`. (A future experiment could unify the two; this one does
not.)

## Upstream behavior

`terminal/UTF8Decoder.zig` is a byte-at-a-time state machine over two lookup
tables:

- `char_classes: [256]u4` — maps each byte to one of 12 character classes.
- `transitions: [108]u8` — the DFA transition table, indexed by
  `state + char_class`. States are multiples of 12 (`0, 12, 24, …, 96`);
  `ACCEPT_STATE = 0`, `REJECT_STATE = 12`.

State: an `accumulator: u21` (the codepoint under construction) and `state: u8`
(starting at `ACCEPT_STATE`). `next(byte)` returns a tuple `{ ?u21, bool }` —
the decoded codepoint (if any) and whether the byte was **consumed**:

```zig
pub inline fn next(self, byte) struct { ?u21, bool } {
    const char_class = char_classes[byte];
    const initial_state = self.state;
    if (self.state != ACCEPT_STATE) {
        self.accumulator <<= 6;
        self.accumulator |= (byte & 0x3F);            // continuation: 6 data bits
    } else {
        self.accumulator = (@as(u21, 0xFF) >> char_class) & byte; // first byte: class-masked
    }
    self.state = transitions[self.state + char_class];
    if (self.state == ACCEPT_STATE) {
        defer self.accumulator = 0;
        return .{ self.accumulator, true };           // full codepoint, consumed
    } else if (self.state == REJECT_STATE) {
        self.accumulator = 0;
        self.state = ACCEPT_STATE;
        // Replacement char. Consumed iff we rejected the FIRST byte of a sequence.
        return .{ 0xFFFD, initial_state == ACCEPT_STATE };
    } else {
        return .{ null, true };                        // mid-sequence, consumed, nothing emitted
    }
}
```

The only un-consumed case is an ill-formed continuation: a replacement character
is emitted and the caller must re-feed the same byte (it begins a new sequence).
Upstream's three tests:

- **ASCII** — `"Hello, World!"`: every byte consumed, each emits its own
  codepoint.
- **Well-formed** — `"😄✤ÁA"` (4-, 3-, 2-, 1-byte): every byte consumed first
  try, codepoints `0x1F604, 0x2724, 0xC1, 0x41`.
- **Partially invalid** — `"\xF0\x9F" ++ "😄" ++ "\xED\xA0\x80"` (truncated
  lead, valid sequence, surrogate): emits
  `0xFFFD, 0x1F604, 0xFFFD, 0xFFFD, 0xFFFD`.

## Rust mapping (`roastty/src/terminal/utf8_decoder.rs`)

A direct transcription. The two tables are copied **verbatim**; `u21` becomes
`u32` (Rust has no `u21`; every value fits in 21 bits) and the `{ ?u21, bool }`
tuple becomes `(Option<u32>, bool)`.

```rust
//! A DFA-based, non-allocating, error-replacing UTF-8 decoder (port of upstream
//! `terminal/UTF8Decoder`).
//!
//! Based on Bjoern Hoehrmann's DFA decoder (http://bjoern.hoehrmann.de/utf-8/decoder/dfa, MIT),
//! with error replacement. The two lookup tables are copied verbatim from upstream.

## Scope / faithfulness notes

- **Ported (1:1)**: `terminal/UTF8Decoder.zig` →
  `terminal::utf8_decoder::Utf8Decoder`. The `char_classes` (256) and
  `transitions` (108) tables are copied verbatim; the state machine
  (`accumulator` shift-or for continuations, class-masked first byte, transition
  lookup, the three return cases) is identical.
- **Faithful adaptation**: `u21` → `u32` (Rust lacks `u21`; all values fit in 21
  bits); the `{ ?u21, bool }` tuple → `(Option<u32>, bool)`; the
  `defer accumulator = 0` → an explicit reset before the accept-state return.
  The unused `std.log` scope is dropped.
- **Independent of `stream.rs`**: roastty's `terminal/stream.rs` keeps its own
  separate length-based decoder; this experiment adds the faithful DFA decoder
  as a standalone module and does **not** rewire the stream (a later experiment
  could unify them).
- **Deferred**: nothing — the upstream file is fully covered.
- No C ABI/header/ABI-inventory change (internal Rust). Adds
  `terminal::utf8_decoder`.

## Changes

1. `roastty/src/terminal/utf8_decoder.rs` (new): the tables, state constants,
   `Utf8Decoder` with `new` / `next` as above.
2. `roastty/src/terminal/mod.rs`: add `#[allow(dead_code)] mod utf8_decoder;`
   (alphabetical).
3. Tests (in `utf8_decoder.rs`), the three upstream tests plus a re-feed
   assertion:
   - **ASCII**: `"Hello, World!"` — every byte consumed, codepoints reconstruct
     the string.
   - **well-formed**: `"😄✤ÁA"` — every byte consumed first try; codepoints
     `[0x1F604, 0x2724, 0xC1, 0x41]`.
   - **partially invalid**: `b"\xF0\x9F" ++ "😄" ++ b"\xED\xA0\x80"` —
     codepoints `[0xFFFD, 0x1F604, 0xFFFD, 0xFFFD, 0xFFFD]`.
   - **un-consumed byte is re-fed**: assert that in the partially-invalid case
     at least one `next` returns `consumed == false` (the rejecting byte that
     begins a new sequence), validating the re-feed contract.
4. Format and test (`cargo fmt`, accept output).

## Verification

```bash
cargo fmt
cargo fmt -- --check
cargo test -p roastty terminal::utf8_decoder
cargo test -p roastty
cargo build -p roastty            # no warnings
rg -n 'ghostty|Ghostty|GHOSTTY' roastty/src/font roastty/src/renderer roastty/src/config roastty/src/terminal/utf8_decoder.rs && exit 1 || true
rg -n 'ghostty|Ghostty|GHOSTTY' roastty/src/lib.rs roastty/include/roastty.h roastty/tests/abi_harness.c && exit 1 || true
git diff --check
```

The experiment **passes** if:

- `Utf8Decoder` reproduces upstream's DFA decoding exactly — the verbatim
  tables, the accumulator construction, the transition lookup, and the accept /
  reject (replacement, consumed-iff-first-byte) / mid-sequence return cases —
  faithful to `terminal/UTF8Decoder.zig`;
- the three upstream test vectors pass (ASCII / well-formed / partially-invalid)
  plus the re-feed assertion, and the existing tests still pass;
- `cargo fmt` accepted, `cargo build -p roastty` has no warnings, and
  `cargo test -p roastty` passes with no regressions;
- the no-`ghostty`-name gates and `git diff --check` pass;
- Codex reviews the design before implementation and the result after, with all
  real findings fixed.

The experiment **fails** if the table contents, the state-machine arithmetic, or
the return-tuple semantics (codepoint / consumed) diverge from upstream, an
unrelated item changes, or any public C API/ABI changes.

## Design Review

Codex reviewed the design and **approved it with no findings**. It mechanically
compared the design's `CHAR_CLASSES` (256) and `TRANSITIONS` (108) tables
against `terminal/UTF8Decoder.zig` and confirmed both lengths and contents match
exactly; the state arithmetic and return semantics are faithful (including the
`consumed == false` reject case and the reset behavior). The `u21 → u32`,
`(Option<u32>, bool)`, `Default` state initialization, and standalone
unused-module scope are all acceptable adaptations, the test vectors match
upstream, and the re-feed assertion covers the key caller contract.
