# Experiment 78: Port Line Iterator

## Description

Port upstream `Screen.LineIterator` / `Screen.lineIterator` into Roastty's
current PageList-centered terminal model.

Experiments 75-77 completed the private PageList line, select-all, and
semantic-output selection primitives. Upstream `LineIterator` is the next small
selection-layer helper: starting at a pin, repeatedly return full soft-wrapped
line selections with whitespace trimming disabled and semantic prompt boundaries
disabled, then advance to the row after the selected line.

This experiment should add only the PageList-local line iterator and tests. It
must not add `Screen`, `Terminal`, `ScreenFormatter`, `selectionString`,
string-map support, gesture state, public ABI, renderer, parser, app, platform
input, mouse event behavior, clipboard behavior, or UI wiring.

## Changes

1. Re-read the upstream source of truth.
   - Use `vendor/ghostty/src/terminal/Screen.zig` for:
     - `LineIterator`;
     - `lineIterator`;
     - `test "Screen: lineIterator"`;
     - `test "Screen: lineIterator soft wrap"`.
   - Use existing Roastty code:
     - `roastty/src/terminal/page_list.rs`;
     - `roastty/src/terminal/selection.rs`;
     - the private `SelectLineOptions` and `PageList::select_line` helper from
       Experiment 75.
   - Do not modify `vendor/ghostty/`.

2. Add a private PageList line iterator type.
   - Preferred shape:

     ```rust
     struct LineIterator<'a> {
         list: &'a PageList,
         current: Option<Pin>,
     }

     impl Iterator for LineIterator<'_> {
         type Item = selection::Selection;
     }
     ```

   - `next()` should match upstream:
     - if `current` is `None`, return `None`;
     - call `select_line` with:
       - `pin = current`;
       - `whitespace = None`;
       - `semantic_prompt_boundary = false`;
     - if `select_line` returns `None`, set `current = None` and return `None`;
     - otherwise set `current` to one row below `result.end()` using the
       existing PageList pin movement helper. If there is no row below, set
       `current = None`;
     - return the selected line.
   - Returned selections should be untracked and non-rectangular because they
     come from `select_line`.

3. Add a private PageList constructor helper.
   - Preferred shape:

     ```rust
     fn line_iterator(&self, start: Pin) -> LineIterator<'_>
     ```

   - Invalid or garbage start pins should produce an iterator whose first
     `next()` returns `None`.
   - Keep the helper private. Do not add public API or C ABI.

4. Add upstream-equivalent tests.
   - Port `Screen: lineIterator` as selection-bound tests:
     - with a `5x5` PageList containing `1ABCD` and `2EFGH`, starting at the
       viewport/screen top-left yields `(0, 0)..(4, 0)`, `(0, 1)..(4, 1)`,
       `(0, 2)..(4, 2)`, `(0, 3)..(4, 3)`, and `(0, 4)..(4, 4)`, then `None`.
       This matches upstream because `LineIterator` disables whitespace
       trimming, so empty physical rows are still yielded as full-row
       selections.
   - Port `Screen: lineIterator soft wrap` as selection-bound tests:
     - with a `5x5` PageList containing `1ABCD2EFGH` as a soft-wrapped line
       followed by `3ABCD`, starting at the viewport/screen top-left yields
       `(0, 0)..(4, 1)`, `(0, 2)..(4, 2)`, `(0, 3)..(4, 3)`, and
       `(0, 4)..(4, 4)`, then `None`.
   - Add Roastty-specific coverage:
     - starting from a non-wrapped second physical row yields that row first;
     - starting from the continuation row of a soft-wrapped line yields the full
       soft-wrapped line, not only that physical row;
     - invalid and garbage start pins immediately return `None`;
     - iterator selections are untracked and non-rectangular;
     - a scrollback/history fixture proves the iterator uses the supplied start
       pin's coordinate domain and can yield selections outside the active
       viewport when started from a screen pin.
   - Because Roastty does not yet have `selectionString`, verify selection
     bounds rather than copied text.

5. Keep scope narrow.
   - Do not add selection string extraction or formatter behavior.
   - Do not add gesture, keyboard shortcut, clipboard, app, terminal, or UI
     behavior.
   - Do not add public API or C ABI exposure.

6. Verify.
   - Run:

     ```bash
     cargo fmt
     cargo test -p roastty line_iterator
     cargo test -p roastty terminal::page_list
     cargo test -p roastty
     ```

   - `cargo fmt` output must be accepted as-is.

7. Independent review.
   - Before implementation, get Codex review of this experiment design.
   - Record the design-review outcome in this experiment file before
     implementation.
   - After implementation and verification, get Codex review of the completed
     result.
   - Fix all real findings before proceeding.

8. Record the result.
   - Append `## Result` and `## Conclusion` to this file.
   - Include:
     - helper names and location;
     - upstream test coverage;
     - Roastty-specific edge tests;
     - verification command output summary;
     - Codex design-review outcome;
     - Codex result-review outcome.
   - Update the Issue 801 README experiment index from `Designed` to `Pass`,
     `Partial`, or `Fail`.

## Verification

The experiment passes if:

- Roastty has a private PageList line iterator equivalent to upstream
  `LineIterator`;
- each yielded selection is the full soft-wrapped line with whitespace trimming
  disabled and semantic boundaries disabled;
- iteration advances to the row after the selected line and stops at the bottom
  of the screen domain;
- invalid or garbage start pins return no selections;
- iterator selections are untracked and non-rectangular;
- no `Screen`, `Terminal`, `ScreenFormatter`, `selectionString`, string-map
  support, gesture state, public ABI, renderer, parser, app, platform input,
  mouse event behavior, clipboard behavior, or UI wiring is added;
- `cargo fmt`, targeted line-iterator tests, PageList tests, and full
  `cargo test -p roastty` pass;
- Codex design and result reviews approve the experiment, or all real findings
  are fixed before proceeding.

The experiment is partial if:

- ordinary line iteration works, but scrollback or start-domain behavior exposes
  a missing PageList fixture that must be split into its own prerequisite
  experiment.

The experiment fails if:

- line iteration cannot be implemented without adding Screen, Terminal,
  formatter, ABI, renderer, parser, app, or platform input behavior;
- line iteration trims whitespace or applies semantic boundaries;
- soft-wrapped and hard-bounded rows are yielded incorrectly;
- invalid pins panic instead of returning `None`;
- tests or formatting fail.

## Design Review

Codex reviewed the initial design and found two real blockers:

- the upstream-equivalent tests incorrectly expected iteration to stop after the
  written rows, even though upstream disables whitespace trimming and therefore
  yields empty physical rows through the bottom of the screen;
- "starting from the second physical row" was ambiguous for soft-wrap
  continuations.

The design now requires full-screen empty-row yields for the basic and soft-wrap
upstream-equivalent tests, and separates non-wrapped second-row behavior from a
soft-wrap-continuation start test.

Follow-up Codex review approved the updated design with no remaining blockers.
