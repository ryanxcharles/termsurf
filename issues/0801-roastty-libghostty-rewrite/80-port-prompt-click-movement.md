# Experiment 80: Port Prompt Click Movement

## Description

Port the core line-based movement calculation behind upstream
`Screen.promptClickMove()` into Roastty's current PageList-centered terminal
model.

Experiments 56-60 ported semantic prompt/input/output row and content
highlighting. Experiments 65-79 ported selection geometry and copied-text
primitives. Upstream's next selection-adjacent helper is prompt-click movement:
when shell integration marks prompt input cells, a click inside that input area
can be translated into left/right cursor-key counts.

Upstream `promptClickMove()` lives on `Screen` because it reads the current
cursor semantic state and the configured OSC 133 click mode from screen state.
Roastty does not have `Screen`, cursor state, parser state, or semantic prompt
configuration yet. This experiment should therefore port the reusable core into
PageList with explicit inputs:

- cursor pin;
- current cursor semantic state;
- click pin;
- click mode.

That keeps the movement algorithm faithful and testable now, while leaving the
future `Screen` wrapper to supply the cursor semantic state from real
cursor/parser state. The cursor page-cell semantic content should be derived
from the supplied `cursor_pin`, because upstream treats current cursor semantic
state and cursor page-cell state differently.

## Changes

1. Re-read the upstream source of truth.
   - Use `vendor/ghostty/src/terminal/Screen.zig` for:
     - `PromptClickMove`;
     - `promptClickMove`;
     - `promptClickLine`;
     - tests named `Screen: promptClickMove ...`.
   - Use existing Roastty code:
     - `roastty/src/terminal/page_list.rs`;
     - `roastty/src/terminal/page.rs` for `SemanticContent` and
       `SemanticPrompt`;
     - existing PageList pin validation, row iteration, and semantic helpers.
   - Do not modify `vendor/ghostty/`.

2. Add private prompt-click value types.
   - Preferred shapes:

     ```rust
     #[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq)]
     struct PromptClickMove {
         left: usize,
         right: usize,
     }

     #[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq)]
     enum PromptClickMode {
         None,
         ClickEvents,
         Line,
         Multiple,
         ConservativeVertical,
         SmartVertical,
     }
     ```

   - `PromptClickMove::ZERO` should match upstream `.zero`.
   - Keep both types private. Do not add public API or C ABI exposure.

3. Add private PageList prompt-click movement helpers.
   - Preferred public-to-this-module shape:

     ```rust
     fn prompt_click_move(
         &self,
         cursor_pin: Pin,
         cursor_state_semantic: SemanticContent,
         click_pin: Pin,
         mode: PromptClickMode,
     ) -> PromptClickMove
     ```

   - The helper should match upstream `promptClickMove()`:
     - if either pin is invalid or garbage, return zero;
     - derive the cursor page-cell semantic content from `cursor_pin`;
     - if neither `cursor_state_semantic` nor the cursor page-cell semantic
       content is `SemanticContent::Input`, return zero, matching upstream's
       `cursor.semantic_content OR cursor.page_cell.semantic_content` gate;
     - if `mode` is `None` or `ClickEvents`, return zero;
     - if `mode` is `Line`, `Multiple`, `ConservativeVertical`, or
       `SmartVertical`, call the line-based helper.
   - Add a private `prompt_click_line()` implementing upstream
     `promptClickLine()` against PageList pins.

4. Match upstream line movement semantics.
   - If cursor and click pins are equal, return zero.
   - For cursor-before-click movement:
     - walk rows from cursor to click in screen order;
     - count only `SemanticContent::Input` cells;
     - on the cursor row, start after the cursor column;
     - on continuation rows, start at the first input cell;
     - skip prompt/output/blank cells;
     - stop before non-`SemanticPrompt::PromptContinuation` rows after the
       cursor row;
     - stop at hard row boundaries (`row.wrap() == false`);
     - when stopping at the end of a hard-bounded input row before reaching the
       click, add one movement if the cursor cell semantic content is input, so
       clicking to the right moves to the editor-style end position. This `+1`
       must use the cursor page-cell semantic only, not the separate cursor
       state semantic, matching upstream.
   - For cursor-after-click movement:
     - walk rows from cursor to click in reverse screen order;
     - count only `SemanticContent::Input` cells before the cursor on the cursor
       row and through previous wrapped rows;
     - skip prompt/output/blank cells;
     - stop when the previous row is not a wrap continuation.

5. Add upstream-equivalent tests.
   - Port the upstream prompt-click tests as direct PageList fixtures for:
     - line right basic;
     - cursor not on input;
     - click on same position;
     - line right skips non-input cells;
     - line right soft-wrapped line;
     - disabled when click mode is none;
     - line right stops at hard wrap;
     - line right stops at non-continuation row;
     - line left basic;
     - line left skips non-input cells;
     - line left soft-wrapped line;
     - line left stops at hard wrap;
     - click right of input on the same line;
     - click right of input when cursor is already at the end;
     - click right of input on a lower line;
     - click right of input when cursor is at end and click is on a lower line;
     - click right of input when cursor is on the last input char.
   - Add Roastty-specific guard tests:
     - invalid and garbage cursor/click pins return zero;
     - `ClickEvents` mode returns zero;
     - `Multiple`, `ConservativeVertical`, and `SmartVertical` currently reuse
       line movement, matching upstream;
     - cursor state `Input` plus a non-input/blank cursor cell still allows left
       movement back into input;
     - cursor state `Input` plus a non-input/blank cursor cell does not add the
       hard-row right-edge `+1`;
     - cursor state non-input plus cursor page-cell `Input` still allows
       movement, matching upstream's OR gate;
     - cross-page wrapped input works when cursor and click pins are in
       different PageList nodes.

6. Keep scope narrow.
   - Do not add `Screen`, `Terminal`, cursor structs, parser state, OSC 133
     parser/config parsing, keyboard event emission, mouse event handling,
     public ABI, app, renderer, clipboard, or UI wiring.
   - Do not make this helper public outside the terminal module.
   - Do not change existing selection-string or line-iterator behavior.

7. Verify.
   - Run:

     ```bash
     cargo fmt
     cargo test -p roastty prompt_click
     cargo test -p roastty terminal::page_list
     cargo test -p roastty
     ```

   - `cargo fmt` output must be accepted as-is.

8. Independent review.
   - Before implementation, get Codex review of this experiment design.
   - Record the design-review outcome in this experiment file before
     implementation.
   - After implementation and verification, get Codex review of the completed
     result.
   - Fix all real findings before proceeding.

9. Record the result.
   - Append `## Result` and `## Conclusion` to this file.
   - Include:
     - helper names and location;
     - which upstream prompt-click tests were ported;
     - which Screen/cursor/parser integration pieces are intentionally deferred;
     - verification command output summary;
     - Codex design-review outcome;
     - Codex result-review outcome.
   - Update the Issue 801 README experiment index from `Designed` to `Pass`,
     `Partial`, or `Fail`.

## Verification

The experiment passes if:

- Roastty has private PageList prompt-click movement helpers equivalent to the
  line-based core of upstream `Screen.promptClickMove()` / `promptClickLine()`;
- input-only counting, non-input skipping, same-position zero movement, disabled
  modes, line modes, soft-wrap continuation, hard-wrap stops, lower-line clicks,
  and editor-style end-position movement match the ported upstream tests;
- invalid or garbage cursor/click pins return zero instead of panicking;
- no `Screen`, `Terminal`, cursor structs, parser state, OSC 133 parser/config
  parsing, keyboard event emission, mouse event handling, public ABI, app,
  renderer, clipboard, or UI wiring is added;
- `cargo fmt`, targeted prompt-click tests, PageList tests, and full
  `cargo test -p roastty` pass;
- Codex design and result reviews approve the experiment, or all real findings
  are fixed before proceeding.

The experiment is partial if:

- the line movement core works for same-page fixtures, but a specific cross-page
  or continuation-row behavior exposes a missing lower-level PageList primitive
  that should be split into the next experiment.

The experiment fails if:

- prompt-click movement cannot be implemented without adding `Screen`, parser,
  cursor state, keyboard event emission, public ABI, app, renderer, clipboard,
  or UI behavior;
- movement counts non-input cells;
- hard row boundaries or prompt-continuation boundaries are crossed incorrectly;
- disabled modes move the cursor;
- invalid pins panic;
- tests or formatting fail.

## Design Review

Codex reviewed the initial design and found one real blocker: the helper took
only one cursor semantic value, but upstream uses both current cursor semantic
state and the page-cell semantic content under the cursor. Upstream's top-level
gate allows movement when either is input, while the hard-row right-edge `+1`
uses only the cursor page-cell semantic content.

The design now takes `cursor_state_semantic`, derives cursor page-cell semantic
content from `cursor_pin`, and requires split-state tests for:

- cursor state input plus a non-input/blank cursor cell;
- cursor state input not triggering the page-cell-only right-edge `+1`;
- non-input cursor state plus input cursor page-cell.

Follow-up Codex review approved the updated design with no remaining blockers.

## Result

**Result:** Pass

Implemented private PageList prompt-click movement in
`roastty/src/terminal/page_list.rs`:

- `PromptClickMove` stores left/right cursor-key counts and exposes `ZERO`.
- `PromptClickMode` represents the upstream disabled, click-events, line,
  multiple, conservative-vertical, and smart-vertical modes.
- `PageList::prompt_click_move()` validates cursor/click pins, derives the
  cursor page-cell semantic content from the cursor pin, applies upstream's
  current-cursor-state OR page-cell semantic input gate, keeps disabled modes
  inert, and routes the line-like modes through the line movement core.
- `PageList::prompt_click_line()`, `prompt_click_line_right()`, and
  `prompt_click_line_left()` port the line-based movement calculation over
  PageList pins and rows.

The implementation remains private to the terminal module. It does not add
`Screen`, `Terminal`, cursor structs, parser state, OSC 133 parser/config
parsing, keyboard event emission, mouse event handling, public ABI, app,
renderer, clipboard, or UI wiring.

Ported or covered the upstream-equivalent prompt-click behavior for:

- line-right basic movement;
- cursor not on input;
- same-position zero movement;
- skipping non-input cells;
- soft-wrapped line movement in both directions;
- disabled `None` and `ClickEvents` modes;
- hard-wrap and prompt-continuation stops;
- line-left basic movement;
- lower-line and right-of-input clicks;
- cursor-at-end and cursor-on-last-character edge cases.

Added Roastty-specific guard coverage for:

- invalid and garbage cursor/click pins returning zero;
- `Multiple`, `ConservativeVertical`, and `SmartVertical` modes reusing the line
  movement core, matching upstream today;
- split cursor semantic state vs cursor page-cell semantic behavior;
- cross-page wrapped input movement.

Verification passed:

```bash
cargo fmt
cargo test -p roastty prompt_click
cargo test -p roastty terminal::page_list
cargo test -p roastty
```

Observed results:

- `cargo test -p roastty prompt_click`: 21 passed.
- `cargo test -p roastty terminal::page_list`: 426 passed.
- `cargo test -p roastty`: 719 unit tests passed, ABI harness passed, and
  doctests passed.

Codex reviewed the completed implementation and found no blockers. It confirmed
that the implementation matches the upstream split between cursor semantic state
and cursor page-cell semantic behavior, preserves the page-cell-only hard-row
`+1`, keeps disabled modes inert, routes the line-like modes through the line
core, and covers the required wrap/continuation and cross-page cases.

## Conclusion

Experiment 80 successfully ports the prompt-click movement core into Roastty's
PageList layer. Roastty can now compute upstream-style left/right movement
counts for semantic prompt input clicks without needing the later `Screen`,
cursor, parser, keyboard-emission, or UI integration layers.

The next experiment can continue with the following upstream terminal helper
after `promptClickMove()`, or it can begin splitting the remaining formatter
surface into VT/HTML/pin-map slices now that copied plain text is in place.
