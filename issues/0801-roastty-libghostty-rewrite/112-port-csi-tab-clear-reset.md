# Experiment 112: Port CSI Tab Clear and Reset

## Description

Continue the tabstop stream/action port by adding Ghostty's remaining CSI cursor
tabulation control forms:

- `CSI 2 W` → `tab_clear_current`
- `CSI 5 W` → `tab_clear_all`
- `CSI ? 5 W` → `tab_reset`

Experiment 111 added `CSI W` and `CSI 0 W` as tab-set forms while explicitly
leaving these neighboring actions unsupported. Roastty already has the tabstop
storage operations needed for the terminal side:

- `Tabstops::unset(col)` mirrors upstream `Tabstops.unset()`;
- `Tabstops::reset(0)` clears all tabstops;
- `Tabstops::reset(TABSTOP_INTERVAL)` restores default tabstops.

This experiment wires those existing operations through private stream actions.
It does not add a public CSI parser API, public terminal API, or public ABI.

## Changes

1. Re-read the upstream source of truth.
   - Use `vendor/ghostty/src/terminal/stream.zig` for the
     `Cursor Tabulation Control` branch:
     - `CSI 2 W` emits `.tab_clear_current`;
     - `CSI 5 W` emits `.tab_clear_all`;
     - `CSI ? 5 W` emits `.tab_reset`;
     - other `W` forms remain ignored for this experiment.
   - Use `vendor/ghostty/src/termio/stream_handler.zig` and
     `vendor/ghostty/src/terminal/stream_terminal.zig` for routing those actions
     to terminal tabstop mutation.
   - Use `vendor/ghostty/src/terminal/Terminal.zig` for `tabClear()` and
     `tabReset()`:
     - current clear calls `tabstops.unset(cursor.x)`;
     - all clear calls `tabstops.reset(0)`;
     - reset calls `tabstops.reset(TABSTOP_INTERVAL)`.
   - Do not modify `vendor/ghostty/`.

2. Extend the private stream action surface.
   - Add private actions:
     - `Action::TabClearCurrent`
     - `Action::TabClearAll`
     - `Action::TabReset`
   - Keep `Action::TabSet` unchanged.
   - Do not expose these actions outside the terminal module.

3. Extend CSI `W` parsing without generalizing CSI.
   - Extend the private CSI state from Experiment 111 so it can identify:
     - no params → `TabSet`;
     - single numeric param `0` → `TabSet`;
     - single numeric param `2` → `TabClearCurrent`;
     - single numeric param `5` → `TabClearAll`;
     - private `?` plus single numeric param `5` → `TabReset`.
   - Treat `>` private-marker forms, non-`?` private-marker forms, semicolons,
     multiple params, intermediates, overflowing numeric params, and unsupported
     params as invalid/no-op.
   - Keep unsupported non-`W` CSI finals consumed and ignored.
   - Set the stream parser back to ground before invoking the handler for every
     CSI `W` action, so handler errors cannot leave the parser in CSI state.
   - Preserve pending invalid UTF-8 behavior: if an incomplete invalid UTF-8
     sequence is interrupted by any accepted CSI `W` form, dispatch `U+FFFD`
     before the CSI action.
   - Do not add tab clear/reset through any non-CSI path in this experiment.

4. Add terminal tabstop behavior.
   - `TabClearCurrent` unsets the tabstop at the active cursor column.
   - `TabClearAll` clears all tabstops with `Tabstops::reset(0)`.
   - `TabReset` restores default tabstops with `TABSTOP_INTERVAL`.
   - Leave cursor position unchanged.
   - Leave pending wrap unchanged.
   - Do not modify cells.
   - Do not dirty rows.
   - Do not change `Tabstops::unset()` semantics in this experiment; it already
     mirrors upstream's XOR behavior.

5. Add tests.
   - Stream parser tests:
     - `A\x1b[2WB` dispatches print, tab-clear-current, print;
     - `A\x1b[5WB` dispatches print, tab-clear-all, print;
     - `A\x1b[?5WB` dispatches print, tab-reset, print;
     - split-feed versions of all three accepted forms dispatch the same
       actions;
     - pending invalid UTF-8 dispatches `U+FFFD` before each accepted CSI `W`
       action;
     - handler errors for tab-clear-current, tab-clear-all, and tab-reset leave
       the parser in ground state for the next byte;
     - invalid/deferred forms such as `CSI ? 2 W`, `CSI > 5 W`, `CSI ? 1 W`,
       `CSI 1 W`, `CSI 99 W`, `CSI 0 ; 5 W`, and overflowing params dispatch no
       new action and recover for the next byte;
     - `CSI W` and `CSI 0 W` keep dispatching `TabSet`.
   - Terminal tests:
     - after moving to the default tabstop at column 8, `CSI 2 W` clears that
       stop so the next `HT` from column 0 moves to column 16;
     - `CSI 5 W` clears all stops so the next `HT` from column 0 clamps to the
       right edge;
     - after `CSI 5 W`, `CSI ? 5 W` restores defaults so the next `HT` from
       column 0 moves to column 8;
     - each action leaves cursor position unchanged;
     - each action preserves pending wrap at the right edge;
     - each action does not dirty rows or modify cells by itself.
   - Existing stream, `ESC H`, CSI tab-set, horizontal-tab, formatter, PageList,
     and ABI tests must keep passing.

6. Verify.
   - Run:

     ```bash
     cargo fmt
     cargo test -p roastty stream
     cargo test -p roastty terminal_formatter
     cargo test -p roastty terminal::terminal
     cargo test -p roastty screen_formatter
     cargo test -p roastty page_string
     cargo test -p roastty terminal::page_list
     cargo test -p roastty
     ```

   - `cargo fmt` output must be accepted as-is.

7. Independent review.
   - Before implementation, get Codex review of this experiment design.
   - Fix all real design findings before implementation.
   - Record the design-review outcome in this experiment file before
     implementation.
   - Commit the approved design before implementation.
   - After implementation and verification, get Codex review of the completed
     result.
   - Fix all real result findings before proceeding.
   - Commit the approved result separately from the design commit.

8. Record the result.
   - Append `## Result` and `## Conclusion` to this file.
   - Include:
     - accepted and rejected CSI `W` forms;
     - stream parser state behavior on handler errors;
     - terminal tabstop mutation behavior;
     - pending-wrap, dirty-row, and cell behavior;
     - what remains deferred;
     - verification command output summary;
     - Codex design-review outcome;
     - Codex result-review outcome.
   - Update the Issue 801 README experiment index from `Designed` to `Pass`,
     `Partial`, or `Fail`.

## Verification

The experiment passes if:

- `CSI 2 W` dispatches `Action::TabClearCurrent`;
- `CSI 5 W` dispatches `Action::TabClearAll`;
- `CSI ? 5 W` dispatches `Action::TabReset`;
- split-feed versions of all three dispatch the same actions;
- `CSI W` and `CSI 0 W` keep dispatching `Action::TabSet`;
- invalid forms such as `CSI ? 2 W`, `CSI > 5 W`, `CSI ? 1 W`, `CSI 1 W`,
  `CSI 99 W`, `CSI 0 ; 5 W`, and overflowing params dispatch no tab action and
  recover for the next byte;
- pending invalid UTF-8 emits `U+FFFD` before each accepted CSI `W` action;
- handler errors from all accepted CSI `W` actions leave the parser in ground
  state for the next byte;
- current clear removes the active cursor column from tabstop navigation;
- all clear removes all tabstops;
- reset restores the default tabstop interval;
- all three terminal actions leave cursor position and pending wrap unchanged;
- all three terminal actions do not dirty rows or modify cells by themselves;
- no horizontal-tab-back, margins, origin mode, no-scrollback rotation, styles,
  hyperlinks, wide/Unicode handling, public API, or public ABI are added;
- `cargo fmt` and the listed tests pass;
- Codex design and result reviews approve the experiment, or all real findings
  are fixed before proceeding.

The experiment is partial if:

- stream parsing dispatches the new actions correctly, but terminal tabstop
  mutation exposes a mismatch in the already-ported `Tabstops` storage that
  requires a separate storage-focused experiment.

The experiment fails if:

- any accepted CSI `W` form remains silently ignored;
- invalid CSI `W` forms dispatch a tab action;
- CSI bytes leak as printable text;
- handler errors leave the parser stuck in CSI state;
- terminal tabstop mutation targets the wrong column or reset interval;
- any tab clear/reset action moves the cursor, clears pending wrap, dirties
  rows, or modifies cells;
- public API or ABI changes are added.

## Design Review

Codex reviewed this design before implementation.

Review artifacts:

- Prompt: `logs/codex-review/20260601-022752-425781-prompt.md`
- Result: `logs/codex-review/20260601-022752-425781-last-message.md`

The helper reported that the stored Codex session was full and automatically
started a fresh session, as required by the review skill.

Codex found no design blockers. It confirmed the accepted CSI `W` forms,
terminal tabstop mutations, scope boundaries, and test plan match upstream
Ghostty and Roastty's current shape. It noted that the existing unsupported CSI
`W` variant test from Experiment 111 will need to move `CSI 2 W`, `CSI 5 W`, and
`CSI ? 5 W` into accepted-action coverage during implementation.

## Result

**Result:** Pass.

Implemented the remaining Ghostty CSI cursor-tabulation-control tabstop actions:

- `CSI 2 W` dispatches `Action::TabClearCurrent`;
- `CSI 5 W` dispatches `Action::TabClearAll`;
- `CSI ? 5 W` dispatches `Action::TabReset`.

Accepted and rejected CSI `W` forms:

- `CSI W` and `CSI 0 W` continue to dispatch `Action::TabSet`.
- `CSI 2 W`, `CSI 5 W`, and `CSI ? 5 W` now dispatch their new private tab
  actions.
- Invalid forms including `CSI ? W`, `CSI > W`, `CSI ? 2 W`, `CSI > 5 W`,
  `CSI ? 1 W`, `CSI 1 W`, `CSI 99 W`, `CSI 0 ; 5 W`, and overflowing numeric
  params dispatch no tab action and recover for the next printable byte.

Stream parser behavior:

- CSI state now tracks `?` private-marker forms separately from ordinary numeric
  params.
- Numeric params are still parsed with checked arithmetic.
- Unsupported non-`W` CSI finals remain consumed and ignored.
- The parser returns to ground before invoking the handler for `TabSet`,
  `TabClearCurrent`, `TabClearAll`, and `TabReset`, so handler errors cannot
  leave the parser stuck in CSI state.
- Pending invalid UTF-8 dispatches `U+FFFD` before accepted tab clear/reset
  actions, matching the existing stream-control ordering.

Terminal tabstop behavior:

- `TabClearCurrent` unsets the tabstop at the active cursor column through a new
  private `Screen::tab_clear_current_basic()` helper.
- `TabClearAll` clears all tabstops with `Tabstops::reset(0)`.
- `TabReset` restores the default tabstop interval with
  `Tabstops::reset(TABSTOP_INTERVAL)`.
- The default interval literal was named `TABSTOP_INTERVAL` and reused for
  initialization and reset.
- The existing `Tabstops::unset()` XOR behavior was preserved because it mirrors
  upstream Ghostty.
- Tab clear/reset actions leave cursor position and pending wrap unchanged.
- Tab clear/reset actions do not dirty rows or modify cells by themselves.

This experiment did not implement horizontal-tab-back, margins, origin mode,
no-scrollback rotation, styles, hyperlinks, wide/Unicode handling, public API,
or public ABI.

Verification run:

```text
cargo fmt
cargo test -p roastty stream
cargo test -p roastty terminal_formatter
cargo test -p roastty terminal::terminal
cargo test -p roastty screen_formatter
cargo test -p roastty page_string
cargo test -p roastty terminal::page_list
cargo test -p roastty
```

Results:

- `cargo fmt` passed.
- `cargo test -p roastty stream` passed 162 tests.
- `cargo test -p roastty terminal_formatter` passed 67 tests.
- `cargo test -p roastty terminal::terminal` passed 130 tests.
- `cargo test -p roastty screen_formatter` passed 55 tests.
- `cargo test -p roastty page_string` passed 12 tests.
- `cargo test -p roastty terminal::page_list` passed 524 tests.
- Full `cargo test -p roastty` passed 1063 unit tests, the ABI harness, and
  doc-tests.

Codex design review passed without required changes.

Result-review artifacts:

- Prompt: `logs/codex-review/20260601-023308-996342-prompt.md`
- Result: `logs/codex-review/20260601-023308-996342-last-message.md`

Codex found no code correctness issues. It confirmed the implementation matches
the approved experiment, the tests cover the accepted and rejected forms plus
terminal mutation behavior, and the result is good enough to commit after
recording this review outcome.

## Conclusion

Roastty now supports Ghostty's tabstop set, clear-current, clear-all, and reset
actions for the CSI `W` cursor tabulation control family. Together with
Experiments 108, 110, and 111, the basic horizontal-tab and tabstop control path
is now covered for stream parsing and terminal mutation.

The next stream-control experiment should move beyond tabstop control, likely to
the next small upstream escape/control action that can reuse the current private
stream-action pattern without broadening into a full CSI parser.
