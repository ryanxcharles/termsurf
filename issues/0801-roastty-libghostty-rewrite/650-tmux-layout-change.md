# Experiment 650: Tmux Layout Change

## Description

Port the tmux viewer `LayoutChange` notification as a window-layout-only update.

Experiment 649 left `LayoutChange` explicitly ignored because upstream's handler
crosses into `syncLayouts`. The first half of upstream `layoutChanged` has a
useful smaller boundary: find the existing window, parse the checked layout,
update that window's layout, and emit a `windows` action. This experiment should
implement only that pre-`syncLayouts` behavior.

It must not create/prune panes, queue pane capture/state commands, process pane
output, write to the PTY, or integrate with App/Surface runtime code.

## Changes

1. Extend command-queue `ControlNotification::LayoutChange` handling in
   `roastty/src/terminal/tmux.rs`:
   - find the existing `TmuxWindow` by `window_id`;
   - if the window is unknown, ignore the notification and emit no action;
   - parse the notification's `layout` with `Layout::parse_with_checksum`;
   - on parse failure, move the viewer to `Defunct` and emit `Exit`, matching
     upstream command-output error handling for failed layout parsing;
   - update the stored window layout;
   - emit `TmuxViewerAction::Windows(self.windows.clone())`;
   - do not use `visible_layout` or `raw_flags` yet.
2. Preserve command queue sequencing:
   - `LayoutChange` does not consume the in-flight command;
   - if a command is already queued/in flight, do not emit a command;
   - if the queue is empty, do not invent a new command.
3. Keep these upstream behaviors explicitly out of scope:
   - `syncLayouts`;
   - pane map creation and pruning;
   - queuing `PaneHistory`, `PaneVisible`, and `PaneState` from changed layouts;
   - pane output handling;
   - PTY writes and App/Surface runtime integration.
4. Add tests for:
   - known-window layout change updates only that window and emits the full
     window snapshot;
   - unknown-window layout change is ignored;
   - invalid checked layout defuncts and emits `Exit`;
   - layout change does not consume or emit pending queued commands;
   - `visible_layout` and `raw_flags` are ignored for now.
5. Keep the README's overall `tmux` checklist item unchecked, refining it after
   the result to say layout-change window updates are done while pane sync, PTY,
   and App integration remain missing.
6. Update this experiment file with result and review records.

## Verification

- `cargo test -p roastty terminal::tmux`
- `cargo fmt -p roastty`
- `cargo fmt -p roastty -- --check`
- `prettier --write --prose-wrap always --print-width 80 issues/0801-roastty-libghostty-rewrite/README.md issues/0801-roastty-libghostty-rewrite/650-tmux-layout-change.md`
- compare/read the Rust layout-change handling against:
  - `vendor/ghostty/src/terminal/tmux/viewer.zig` `layoutChanged`
  - `vendor/ghostty/src/terminal/tmux/viewer.zig` `syncLayouts` boundary
- `git diff --check`

Pass = Roastty's standalone tmux viewer updates known-window layouts from
`LayoutChange`, emits the updated window snapshot, keeps unknown windows as
no-ops, defuncts on invalid layouts, and leaves pane/layout synchronization and
runtime integration open.

Fail = invalid layouts are silently accepted, unknown windows mutate state,
queued commands are consumed or emitted incorrectly, pane sync is implemented
prematurely, or the README overclaims full tmux support.

## Design Review

Codex design review session `019e9ad7-04a6-7b20-823a-fa6e3d24129f` found no
blocking issues and approved the experiment for implementation. The reviewer
confirmed that the plan matches the pre-`syncLayouts` upstream boundary: known
windows update and emit a full `Windows` snapshot, unknown windows are ignored,
invalid layouts defunct the viewer, queued commands are not consumed or emitted,
`visible_layout` and `raw_flags` are ignored, and pane/runtime integration
remains out of scope.

## Result

**Result:** Pass

Implemented command-queue `LayoutChange` handling in
`roastty/src/terminal/tmux.rs`. Known windows now parse the notification's
checked `layout` with `Layout::parse_with_checksum`, update the stored
`TmuxWindow` layout, and emit a full `Windows` snapshot. Unknown windows are
ignored, matching upstream's early return. Invalid checked layouts move the
viewer to `Defunct` and emit `Exit`.

`LayoutChange` does not consume or emit queued commands. The notification's
`visible_layout` and `raw_flags` fields remain ignored in this slice.

The intended upstream boundary remains intact. This experiment does not port
`syncLayouts`, does not create/prune panes, does not queue pane
history/visible/state commands, and does not integrate with PTY, App, or Surface
runtime code.

Verification performed:

- `cargo fmt -p roastty`
- `cargo test -p roastty terminal::tmux` — 95 passed, 0 failed

Source comparison was against `vendor/ghostty/src/terminal/tmux/viewer.zig`
`layoutChanged` and the `syncLayouts` boundary.

## Completion Review

Codex completion review session `019e9ad7-04a6-7b20-823a-fa6e3d24129f` found no
blocking issues and approved the completed experiment. The reviewer confirmed
that command-queue `LayoutChange` updates known windows with
`Layout::parse_with_checksum`, emits a full `Windows` snapshot, ignores unknown
windows, defuncts on invalid layouts, leaves queued commands untouched, ignores
`visible_layout` and `raw_flags`, and does not add `syncLayouts`, pane
management, PTY, App, or Surface integration.

The reviewer also ran:

- `cargo test -p roastty terminal::tmux` — 95 passed
- `cargo fmt -p roastty -- --check`
- `prettier --check ... README.md ... 650-tmux-layout-change.md`
- `git diff --check`

## Conclusion

Roastty's standalone tmux viewer now updates stored window layouts on
`LayoutChange` without crossing into pane synchronization. The next tmux
experiment should begin the `syncLayouts` pane-state boundary or explicitly
split out pane ID discovery from layout trees before creating terminal state.
