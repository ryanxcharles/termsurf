# Experiment 36: Port PageList Scrollbar State

## Description

Port the read-only PageList scrollbar state calculation from upstream Ghostty:

- `Scrollbar`
- `scrollbar`
- `viewportRowOffset`
- `pinIsActive`
- `pinIsTop`

Experiments 33-35 created initialized PageLists, point-to-pin conversion, and
tracked-pin ownership. This experiment should add the next narrow read-only
viewport behavior needed by rendering/UI code: reporting the scrollable row
range, the current viewport offset, and the visible viewport length.

This experiment should not implement the `scroll` command, grow/prune behavior,
row erasure, resize, reflow, mutation-time viewport fixups, or public ABI.

## Changes

1. Re-read upstream source.
   - Use `vendor/ghostty/src/terminal/PageList.zig` as the source of truth for:
     - `Scrollbar`;
     - `scrollbar`;
     - `viewportRowOffset`;
     - `pinIsActive`;
     - `pinIsTop`.
   - Inspect upstream scrollbar tests for expected values, but port only the
     cases reachable from the current Roastty PageList surface.
   - Do not modify `vendor/ghostty/`.

2. Add the scrollbar value type.
   - Add an internal Rust `Scrollbar` struct with:
     - `total: usize`;
     - `offset: usize`;
     - `len: usize`.
   - Derive `Debug`, `Clone`, `Copy`, `PartialEq`, and `Eq`.
   - Add `Scrollbar::ZERO` only if it is useful for tests or later callsites.
   - Do not add the C ABI mirror yet. Upstream's `Scrollbar.C` maps to
     app-facing action data, but Roastty does not expose that boundary in the
     current skeleton.

3. Add viewport row offset cache storage.
   - Add `viewport_pin_row_offset: Option<usize>` to `PageList`.
   - Initialize it to `None`.
   - Use it only for `Viewport::Pin`, matching upstream.
   - Do not add mutation invalidation beyond the code touched in this
     experiment, because grow/prune/erase/reflow are not implemented yet.

4. Extend integrity for pin viewports.
   - Add integrity errors equivalent to upstream's:
     - `ViewportPinOffsetMismatch`;
     - `ViewportPinInsufficientRows`.
   - When `viewport == Viewport::Pin`, compute the viewport pin's absolute row
     offset by direct PageList traversal.
   - If `viewport_pin_row_offset` is populated, verify that it matches the
     direct traversal result.
   - Verify that `total_rows - actual_offset >= rows`, so a pinned viewport has
     enough rows available to render a full viewport.
   - Add tests for both integrity failures.

5. Port `pin_is_active`.
   - Shape it as:

     ```rust
     fn pin_is_active(&self, pin: Pin) -> bool
     ```

   - Match upstream semantics:
     - compare the pin against `get_top_left(Tag::Active)`;
     - a pin in the active top-left node is active if its row is at or below the
       active top-left row;
     - a pin in any later node is active;
     - earlier nodes are not active.
   - Use current `Vec<Box<Node>>` index traversal instead of upstream intrusive
     linked-list traversal.

6. Port `pin_is_top`.
   - Shape it as:

     ```rust
     fn pin_is_top(&self, pin: Pin) -> bool
     ```

   - Return true only when the pin is row zero in the first page node.

7. Port `viewport_row_offset`.
   - Shape it as an internal method:

     ```rust
     fn viewport_row_offset(&mut self) -> usize
     ```

   - Match upstream semantics:
     - `Viewport::Top` returns `0`;
     - `Viewport::Active` returns `total_rows - rows`;
     - `Viewport::Pin` returns the cached offset if present;
     - otherwise, compute the pin's absolute row offset from the top, cache it,
       and return it.
   - It is acceptable for the method to take `&mut self` so it can populate the
     cache in safe Rust.
   - Keep the calculation based on current page sizes and node identity, not on
     `point_from_pin`, so the cache path remains a faithful adaptation of
     upstream's direct PageList traversal.
   - On every `Viewport::Pin` path, including cache hits, call or otherwise
     satisfy integrity so the cached value and "enough rows" invariants are
     checked in the same spirit as upstream's `defer self.assertIntegrity()`.

8. Port `scrollbar`.
   - Shape it as:

     ```rust
     fn scrollbar(&mut self) -> Scrollbar
     ```

   - Match upstream's no-scrollback special case:
     - if `explicit_max_size == 0`, return `total = rows`, `offset = 0`,
       `len = rows`;
     - otherwise, return `total = total_rows`, `offset = viewport_row_offset()`,
       `len = rows`.
   - Do not hide allocated extra page capacity except through the existing
     `total_rows` field, matching upstream.

9. Add tests.
   - Initial PageList reports `Scrollbar { total: rows, offset: 0, len: rows }`.
   - A `max_size = Some(0)` PageList reports no-scrollback scrollbar semantics
     even if tests manually create extra rows.
   - Active viewport with simulated history reports `total = total_rows`,
     `offset = total_rows - rows`, and `len = rows`.
   - Top viewport reports offset zero.
   - Pin viewport computes the absolute row offset across one page.
   - Pin viewport computes the absolute row offset across multiple pages.
   - Calling `scrollbar` twice for a pin viewport returns the same value and
     populates `viewport_pin_row_offset`.
   - Integrity rejects a populated pin offset cache that disagrees with direct
     traversal.
   - Integrity rejects a pin viewport that does not have enough rows remaining
     to render `rows` visible rows.
   - `pin_is_active` distinguishes pins before the active area, at the active
     top-left, and after the active top-left.
   - `pin_is_top` is true only for row zero in the first node.

10. Preserve scope.
    - Do not implement:
      - `Scroll`;
      - `scroll`;
      - grow/prune/erase/reset/resize/reflow;
      - viewport fixups after mutation;
      - scrollbar C ABI;
      - renderer or app integration;
      - public API additions.
    - Do not add `ghostty` names except when citing upstream paths or test
      provenance.

11. Verify.
    - Run:

      ```bash
      cargo fmt
      cargo test -p roastty terminal::page_list
      cargo test -p roastty
      ```

    - `cargo fmt` output must be accepted as-is.

12. Record the result.
    - Append `## Result` and `## Conclusion` to this file.
    - Include:
      - scrollbar value shape;
      - viewport cache behavior;
      - integrity checks added;
      - tests added;
      - verification command output summary.
    - Update the Issue 801 README experiment index from `Designed` to `Pass`,
      `Partial`, or `Fail`.

## Verification

The experiment passes if:

- `scrollbar` matches upstream no-scrollback, active, top, and pin viewport
  semantics reachable from the current PageList surface;
- pin viewport offsets are cached and reused;
- `pin_is_active` and `pin_is_top` match upstream behavior;
- no scroll/grow/prune/erase/reset/resize/reflow mutation behavior or public ABI
  is introduced;
- `cargo fmt`, targeted PageList tests, and full `cargo test -p roastty` pass;
- an independent agent reviews the experiment design and completed result and
  approves them, or all real findings are fixed.

The experiment is partial if:

- active/top scrollbar behavior works, but pin viewport offset calculation
  exposes a structural mismatch in the current safe Rust PageList storage that
  requires a separate experiment.

The experiment fails if:

- no-scrollback mode reports allocated scrollback capacity instead of
  `rows/0/rows`;
- active viewport offset is not `total_rows - rows`;
- pin viewport offset is computed relative to the active area instead of the top
  of the PageList;
- the cache can return stale values within the non-mutating behavior covered by
  this experiment;
- the implementation expands into scrolling or mutation behavior;
- tests or formatting fail.

## Result

**Result:** Pass

Implemented read-only PageList scrollbar state in
`roastty/src/terminal/page_list.rs`.

The scrollbar value shape is an internal Rust struct:

- `total: usize`;
- `offset: usize`;
- `len: usize`.

The implementation adds:

- `viewport_pin_row_offset: Option<usize>` cache storage;
- `pin_is_active`;
- `pin_is_top`;
- `viewport_row_offset`;
- `scrollbar`;
- a direct traversal helper for the viewport pin's absolute offset.

`scrollbar` matches upstream behavior for the current PageList surface:

- no-scrollback mode (`explicit_max_size == 0`) reports `rows/0/rows`;
- active viewport reports `total_rows / (total_rows - rows) / rows`;
- top viewport reports offset zero;
- pin viewport reports the pin's absolute row offset from the top of the
  PageList and caches that value.

The pin viewport integrity additions from the design review were implemented:

- populated cached offsets must match direct traversal;
- pinned viewports must have enough rows remaining to render a full viewport;
- both failure modes have explicit `IntegrityError` variants and tests.

Added tests for:

- initial scrollbar state;
- no-scrollback scrollbar semantics with simulated extra rows;
- active viewport offset;
- top viewport offset;
- pin viewport offset within one page;
- pin viewport offset across multiple pages;
- pin offset cache reuse;
- cached offset mismatch integrity failure;
- insufficient pinned viewport rows integrity failure;
- `pin_is_active`;
- `pin_is_top`.

Verification passed:

```bash
cargo fmt
cargo test -p roastty terminal::page_list
cargo test -p roastty
```

The targeted PageList suite reported 45 passing tests. The full `roastty` suite
reported 326 unit tests, the ABI harness, and doc tests passing.

## Conclusion

Roastty now has the upstream PageList read-only scrollbar model for initialized
and manually positioned viewports. The implementation reports active, top, and
pin viewport offsets, caches pin offsets, and verifies cached pin viewport state
without introducing scroll commands or mutation behavior. The next PageList
slice can build on this by porting either viewport scrolling commands or another
small read-only helper needed before grow/prune mutation.
