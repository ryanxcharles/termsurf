# Experiment 72: Port Selection Pin Navigation

## Description

Port the PageList-local pin navigation helpers needed by upstream
`SelectionGesture.dragSelection`.

Upstream `SelectionGesture.dragSelection` depends on `Pin.before`,
`Pin.leftClamp`, `Pin.rightClamp`, `Pin.leftWrap`, and `Pin.rightWrap`.
Roastty's `Pin` is a value that stores a `NonNull<Node>`, while `PageList` owns
the page order and can safely validate node membership. Therefore this
experiment should adapt those helpers as private `PageList` methods instead of
adding traversal logic directly to `Pin`.

This experiment is a prerequisite for the next selection-gesture slice. It must
not port `SelectionGesture`, mouse event state, press/release handling,
autoscroll, word selection, line selection, semantic-output selection, Screen,
Terminal, public C ABI, renderer, parser, app, or platform input behavior.

## Changes

1. Re-read the upstream source of truth.
   - Use `vendor/ghostty/src/terminal/PageList.zig` for:
     - `Pin.before`;
     - `Pin.leftClamp`;
     - `Pin.rightClamp`;
     - `Pin.leftWrap`;
     - `Pin.rightWrap`.
   - Use `vendor/ghostty/src/terminal/SelectionGesture.zig::dragSelection` to
     confirm which helper behavior is needed by the next slice.
   - Use existing Roastty code:
     - `roastty/src/terminal/page_list.rs::pin_up`;
     - `roastty/src/terminal/page_list.rs::pin_down`;
     - `roastty/src/terminal/page_list.rs::pin_is_valid`;
     - `roastty/src/terminal/page_list.rs::node_index`.
   - Do not modify `vendor/ghostty/`.

2. Add private `PageList` pin-navigation helpers.
   - Add methods such as:

     ```rust
     fn pin_before(&self, pin: Pin, other: Pin) -> Option<bool>
     fn pin_left_clamp(&self, pin: Pin, cells: CellCountInt) -> Option<Pin>
     fn pin_right_clamp(&self, pin: Pin, cells: CellCountInt) -> Option<Pin>
     fn pin_left_wrap(&self, pin: Pin, cells: usize) -> Option<Pin>
     fn pin_right_wrap(&self, pin: Pin, cells: usize) -> Option<Pin>
     ```

   - The exact names may follow local style, but the behavior must be
     PageList-local and private.
   - The movement parameter is the number of cells to move, matching upstream's
     `n`; it is not the terminal width. Row width must come from the current or
     target PageList row, not from the caller.
   - `pin_before` should:
     - return `None` if either pin is garbage or not valid in this PageList;
     - compare `(node order, y, x)` using the PageList's page order;
     - return `Some(false)` for equal pins.
   - Clamp helpers should:
     - return `None` for garbage or invalid pins;
     - preserve the pin's node, row, and garbage state;
     - move left/right within the same row, saturating at column `0` or the
       row's last column.
   - Wrap helpers should:
     - return `None` for garbage or invalid pins;
     - support the one-cell movement needed by `dragSelection`;
     - move to the adjacent row when crossing a row boundary;
     - return `None` when wrapping would move before the first row or after the
       last row;
     - use `pin_up` / `pin_down` internally if useful, but apply horizontal-wrap
       x semantics explicitly: left wrap sets `x` to the previous row's last
       column, and right wrap sets `x` to `0` when crossing rows.

3. Keep scope narrow.
   - Do not add `selection_gesture.rs` yet.
   - Do not add a public API.
   - Do not add Screen or Terminal.
   - Do not implement word, line, output, autoscroll, press/release, deep-press,
     or mouse-input behavior.
   - Do not alter existing selection tracking, ordering, containment,
     contained-row, or adjustment behavior except where tests prove a helper
     must reuse it.

4. Add tests.
   - Add focused `PageList` tests proving:
     - `pin_before` works within one row;
     - `pin_before` works across rows in one page;
     - `pin_before` works across pages;
     - equal pins are not before each other;
     - invalid or garbage pins return `None`;
     - left clamp moves one cell within a row;
     - left clamp saturates at column `0`;
     - right clamp moves one cell within a row;
     - right clamp saturates at the row's last column;
     - left wrap moves one cell within a row when `x > 0`;
     - left wrap from column `0` moves to the previous row's last column;
     - right wrap moves one cell within a row when `x < last_column`;
     - right wrap from the last column moves to the next row's column `0`;
     - left wrap at the first cell returns `None`;
     - right wrap at the last cell returns `None`;
     - wrap helpers work across page boundaries.
   - Existing PageList and selection tests must continue passing.

5. Verify.
   - Run:

     ```bash
     cargo fmt
     cargo test -p roastty pin_navigation
     cargo test -p roastty terminal::page_list
     cargo test -p roastty
     ```

   - `cargo fmt` output must be accepted as-is.

6. Independent review.
   - Before implementation, get Codex review of this experiment design.
   - Record the design-review outcome in this experiment file before
     implementation.
   - After implementation and verification, get Codex review of the completed
     result.
   - Fix all real findings before proceeding.

7. Record the result.
   - Append `## Result` and `## Conclusion` to this file.
   - Include:
     - helper behavior implemented;
     - tests added;
     - verification command output summary;
     - Codex design-review outcome;
     - Codex result-review outcome.
   - Update the Issue 801 README experiment index from `Designed` to `Pass`,
     `Partial`, or `Fail`.

## Verification

The experiment passes if:

- PageList has private helpers equivalent to the upstream pin ordering,
  clamping, and one-cell wrapping behavior needed by
  `SelectionGesture.dragSelection`;
- invalid or garbage pins return `None`;
- helpers work within a row, across rows, and across PageList page boundaries;
- wrapping returns `None` at the top-left and bottom-right edges;
- no `SelectionGesture`, Screen, Terminal, public ABI, renderer, parser, app,
  word selection, line selection, semantic-output selection, autoscroll,
  press/release, deep-press, or platform input behavior is added;
- `cargo fmt`, targeted pin-navigation tests, PageList tests, and full
  `cargo test -p roastty` pass;
- Codex design and result reviews approve the experiment, or all real findings
  are fixed before proceeding.

The experiment is partial if:

- ordering and clamping work, but wrapping needs a follow-up because it exposes
  a deeper PageList coordinate issue.

The experiment fails if:

- helpers are added to `Pin` in a way that assumes direct linked-list traversal
  unavailable in Roastty's storage model;
- helpers silently accept garbage or missing-node pins;
- wrapping skips rows or mishandles page boundaries;
- the experiment drifts into full `SelectionGesture`, Screen, Terminal, public
  ABI, renderer, parser, app, or mouse-input behavior;
- tests or formatting fail.

## Design Review

Codex reviewed the initial design and required three changes before
implementation:

- rename the movement parameter from `cols` to `cells` or make the helpers
  explicit one-cell helpers, because upstream's argument is a movement count,
  not terminal width;
- add ordinary non-boundary movement tests for clamp and wrap helpers;
- clarify that wrap helpers may reuse `pin_up` / `pin_down`, but must set `x`
  according to horizontal wrapping semantics when crossing rows.

Those changes are incorporated above. A follow-up Codex review must approve this
updated design before implementation begins.

Follow-up Codex review approved the updated design for implementation. No
remaining blockers were found.

## Result

**Result:** Pass

Implemented the PageList-local pin navigation helpers needed before porting
`SelectionGesture.dragSelection`:

- added `PageList::pin_before`;
- added `PageList::pin_left_clamp`;
- added `PageList::pin_right_clamp`;
- added `PageList::pin_left_wrap`;
- added `PageList::pin_right_wrap`;
- added private absolute-row helpers to map between PageList page order and
  wrapped cell positions.

The helpers remain private to `PageList`, reject invalid or garbage pins, and do
not assume that `Pin` can traverse linked-list nodes directly. No
`SelectionGesture`, Screen, Terminal, public ABI, renderer, parser, app, word
selection, line selection, semantic-output selection, autoscroll, press/release,
deep-press, or platform input behavior was added.

Tests added:

- `pin_before` within a row, across rows, across pages, and for equal pins;
- invalid and garbage rejection for `pin_before`;
- left/right clamp ordinary one-cell movement;
- left/right clamp saturation;
- invalid and garbage rejection for clamp helpers;
- left/right wrap ordinary one-cell movement within a row;
- left/right wrap across row boundaries;
- left/right wrap returning `None` at the top-left and bottom-right edges;
- left/right wrap across PageList page boundaries;
- invalid and garbage rejection for wrap helpers.

Verification:

```bash
cargo fmt
cargo test -p roastty pin_navigation
cargo test -p roastty terminal::page_list
cargo test -p roastty
```

Results:

- `cargo test -p roastty pin_navigation`: 10 passed.
- `cargo test -p roastty terminal::page_list`: 337 passed.
- `cargo test -p roastty`: 630 unit tests passed, ABI harness passed, doctests
  passed.

Codex reviewed the implementation and found no code blockers. The only review
requirements were to record this result and update the README status to `Pass`.
Those requirements are reflected here.

## Conclusion

Experiment 72 completed the pin ordering, clamping, and horizontal wrapping
prerequisite for `SelectionGesture.dragSelection`. The next experiment can port
the pure cell-granular drag-selection calculation against these helpers without
pulling in full gesture state, Screen, Terminal, or platform input behavior.
