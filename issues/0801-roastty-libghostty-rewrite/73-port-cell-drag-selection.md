# Experiment 73: Port Cell Drag Selection

## Description

Port the pure cell-granular part of upstream `SelectionGesture.dragSelection`.

Experiment 72 added the PageList-local pin ordering, clamp, and wrap helpers
that `dragSelection` needs. This experiment should now port the calculation that
turns a click pin, drag pin, click pixel x, drag pixel x, rectangle flag, and
grid geometry into an optional untracked `Selection`.

This is not the full `SelectionGesture` port. It must not add press/release
state, double/triple-click handling, autoscroll, deep press, word selection,
line selection, semantic-output selection, Screen, Terminal, public C ABI,
renderer, parser, app, or platform input behavior.

## Changes

1. Re-read the upstream source of truth.
   - Use `vendor/ghostty/src/terminal/SelectionGesture.zig` for:
     - `dragSelection`;
     - `test "SelectionGesture drag selection logic"`;
     - `test "SelectionGesture rectangle drag selection logic"`;
     - the local `testDragSelection` and `testDragSelectionIsNull` helpers.
   - Use existing Roastty code:
     - `roastty/src/terminal/page_list.rs` pin-navigation helpers from
       Experiment 72;
     - `roastty/src/terminal/selection.rs`.
   - Do not modify `vendor/ghostty/`.

2. Add a narrow cell-drag selection helper.
   - Preferred shape:

     ```rust
     struct DragGeometry {
         columns: u32,
         cell_width: u32,
         padding_left: u32,
         screen_height: u32,
     }

     fn drag_selection(
         &self,
         click_pin: Pin,
         drag_pin: Pin,
         click_x: u32,
         drag_x: u32,
         rectangle_selection: bool,
         geometry: DragGeometry,
     ) -> Option<selection::Selection>
     ```

   - The helper may live in `page_list.rs` as a private PageList method, or in a
     new `selection_gesture.rs` module if the PageList pin-navigation helpers
     are exposed only as `pub(super)`.
   - Keep it crate-internal/private. Do not add public C ABI.
   - Use the upstream threshold calculation:
     - threshold is `round(cell_width * 0.6)`;
     - subtract `padding_left` with saturating subtraction;
     - clamp pixel x to `columns * cell_width - 1`;
     - modulo by `cell_width` to get fractional x in the clicked/dragged cell.
   - Return `None` if geometry is invalid enough to make the calculation
     meaningless, such as `columns == 0`, `cell_width == 0`, or
     `columns * cell_width` overflowing `u32`.
   - Use checked arithmetic for `columns * cell_width - 1`, e.g.
     `columns.checked_mul(cell_width).and_then(|v| v.checked_sub(1))`, returning
     `None` on overflow.
   - Use `pin_before` for regular selections and x-only comparison for rectangle
     selections, matching upstream.
   - Use clamp helpers for rectangle selection and wrap helpers for regular
     selection, matching upstream.
   - Preserve upstream wrap-failure fallback: when regular selection asks for
     `leftWrap(1) orelse original_pin` or `rightWrap(1) orelse original_pin`,
     Roastty must use `pin_left_wrap(...).unwrap_or(original_pin)` or
     `pin_right_wrap(...).unwrap_or(original_pin)`. A failed wrap helper must
     not automatically make `drag_selection` return `None`.
   - Return an untracked
     `Selection::new(start_pin, end_pin, rectangle_selection)` on success.

3. Preserve upstream behavior.
   - Same-cell selections should return `None` unless the pointer crosses the
     threshold far enough to include the cell.
   - Adjacent-cell threshold cases that include neither side should return
     `None`.
   - Regular selections may wrap rows.
   - Rectangle selections must not wrap rows horizontally; they clamp columns.
   - Invalid or garbage click/drag pins should return `None`.

4. Add tests.
   - Port the upstream regular selection table:
     - LTR single-cell selection;
     - LTR include both click and drag cells;
     - LTR include click only;
     - LTR include drag only;
     - LTR include neither endpoint but keep middle cell;
     - LTR empty same-cell and adjacent threshold cases;
     - RTL equivalents;
     - regular wrapping cases.
     - edge cases where regular selection wrap fallback reaches a PageList edge
       and still follows upstream `orelse original_pin` behavior instead of
       propagating `None` from the helper.
   - Port the upstream rectangle selection table:
     - LTR single-column selection;
     - LTR include both columns;
     - LTR include click only;
     - LTR include drag only;
     - LTR include neither endpoint but keep middle column;
     - LTR empty threshold cases;
     - RTL equivalents;
     - rectangle non-wrapping cases.
   - Add Roastty-specific tests for:
     - `padding_left` saturating subtraction;
     - invalid `columns == 0`;
     - invalid `cell_width == 0`;
     - overflowing `columns * cell_width`;
     - garbage click or drag pins returning `None`.
   - Existing PageList and selection tests must continue passing.

5. Verify.
   - Run:

     ```bash
     cargo fmt
     cargo test -p roastty drag_selection
     cargo test -p roastty terminal::page_list
     cargo test -p roastty
     ```

   - `cargo fmt` output must be accepted as-is.

6. Independent review.
   - Before implementation, get Codex review of this experiment design.
   - Record the design-review outcome in this experiment file before
     implementation.
   - After implementation and verification, get Codex review of the completed
     result.
   - Fix all real findings before proceeding.

7. Record the result.
   - Append `## Result` and `## Conclusion` to this file.
   - Include:
     - helper shape and location;
     - upstream table coverage;
     - Roastty-specific edge tests;
     - verification command output summary;
     - Codex design-review outcome;
     - Codex result-review outcome.
   - Update the Issue 801 README experiment index from `Designed` to `Pass`,
     `Partial`, or `Fail`.

## Verification

The experiment passes if:

- Roastty has a private helper equivalent to upstream
  `SelectionGesture.dragSelection`;
- regular and rectangular drag-selection tests match the upstream tables;
- regular selections wrap rows, while rectangle selections clamp columns and do
  not wrap;
- same-cell and adjacent threshold empty-selection cases return `None`;
- invalid geometry and invalid/garbage pins return `None`;
- regular-selection wrap-helper failure falls back to the original pin, matching
  upstream `orelse original_pin` behavior;
- no press/release state, double/triple-click handling, autoscroll, deep press,
  word selection, line selection, semantic-output selection, Screen, Terminal,
  public ABI, renderer, parser, app, or platform input behavior is added;
- `cargo fmt`, targeted drag-selection tests, PageList tests, and full
  `cargo test -p roastty` pass;
- Codex design and result reviews approve the experiment, or all real findings
  are fixed before proceeding.

The experiment is partial if:

- regular cell drag selection works, but rectangle mode exposes a mismatch that
  needs its own follow-up.

The experiment fails if:

- the helper depends on full `SelectionGesture`, Screen, Terminal, public ABI,
  renderer, parser, app, or platform input behavior;
- the threshold math differs from upstream without a documented reason;
- wrap-helper failure is propagated as `None` instead of using the upstream
  original-pin fallback;
- rectangle selection wraps horizontally instead of clamping columns;
- invalid geometry panics instead of returning `None`;
- tests or formatting fail.

## Design Review

Codex reviewed the initial design and required two changes before
implementation:

- preserve upstream regular-selection wrap failure fallback to the original pin,
  instead of propagating `None` from the PageList wrap helper;
- use checked arithmetic for `columns * cell_width - 1` and test overflow.

Those changes are incorporated above. A follow-up Codex review must approve this
updated design before implementation begins.

Follow-up Codex review approved the updated design for implementation. No
remaining blockers were found.

## Result

**Result:** Pass

Roastty now has a private `PageList::drag_selection` helper in
`roastty/src/terminal/page_list.rs`. The helper takes click and drag pins, pixel
x positions, a rectangle-selection flag, and private `DragGeometry`, then
returns an untracked `selection::Selection` or `None`.

The implementation ports the pure cell-granular part of upstream
`SelectionGesture.dragSelection` without adding full `SelectionGesture` state,
Screen, Terminal, ABI, renderer, parser, app, platform input, word/line/output
selection, autoscroll, press/release, double/triple-click, or deep-press
behavior.

Coverage added:

- upstream regular drag-selection table cases for LTR, RTL, same-cell empty
  selections, adjacent empty selections, and row wrapping;
- upstream rectangle drag-selection table cases for LTR, RTL, empty selections,
  and non-wrapping column clamping;
- Roastty-specific invalid geometry checks for `columns == 0`,
  `cell_width == 0`, and overflowing `columns * cell_width`;
- Roastty-specific invalid and garbage pin checks;
- padding-left saturating subtraction coverage;
- regular-selection wrap-edge coverage preserving the upstream
  `orelse original_pin` fallback behavior.

Verification passed:

```bash
cargo fmt
cargo test -p roastty drag_selection
cargo test -p roastty terminal::page_list
cargo test -p roastty
```

The targeted drag-selection test run passed 9 tests. The PageList test run
passed 346 tests. The full Roastty test run passed 639 unit tests, the ABI
harness, and doctests.

Codex result review found no code blockers. Its only finding was that the
experiment result and README status still needed to be recorded, which this
section and the README update complete.

## Conclusion

Experiment 73 successfully ports the pure cell drag-selection calculation. The
selection subsystem now has the PageList-local logic needed to convert click and
drag cell geometry into regular or rectangular untracked selections while
matching upstream threshold, wrapping, clamping, and empty-selection behavior.

The next experiment can continue upward from this pure helper toward the next
piece of upstream selection behavior, still preserving the rule that each new
slice must be designed, Codex-reviewed, implemented, result-reviewed, recorded,
and committed separately.
