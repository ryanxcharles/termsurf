# Experiment 705: Binding Action CSI and ESC

## Description

Experiment 704 added byte-oriented binding-action parsing and raw termio writes
for `text:`. Upstream Ghostty's `performBindingAction` also supports:

- `csi:<bytes>` — send `ESC [` followed by the raw parameter bytes;
- `esc:<bytes>` — send `ESC` followed by the raw parameter bytes.

Unlike `text:`, upstream does not decode Zig string-literal escapes for these
two action parameters. `Binding.Action.parse` stores the parameter as a raw byte
slice and `performBindingAction` prepends the escape prefix before queueing one
write request. Both actions then scroll to bottom, which Roastty is deferring
until terminal scrolling / renderer state integration just like the `text:`
slice.

Upstream formats CSI/ESC writes through a fixed local buffer. Roastty will use
an owned `Vec<u8>` in this slice so the ABI can accept the full caller-provided
parameter length; preserving upstream's effective fixed-buffer failure behavior
is not useful until full binding-action error reporting exists.

Roastty now has the required raw write helper and byte-oriented parser. This
experiment extends the binding-action foundation to support `csi:` and `esc:`.

This does not implement cursor-key actions, terminal reset, clipboard actions,
scrolling actions, keybind storage/lookup, or app-scoped actions.

## Changes

- `roastty/src/lib.rs`
  - Extend the internal parsed binding-action enum with raw write variants for
    `csi` and `esc`.
  - Extend `parse_binding_action` to accept `csi:<bytes>` and `esc:<bytes>`
    while rejecting missing parameters.
  - Dispatch `csi:<bytes>` as one raw write of `ESC [` plus the parameter.
  - Dispatch `esc:<bytes>` as one raw write of `ESC` plus the parameter.
  - Return `true` for attached parsed actions even when the parameter is empty
    or no termio worker exists.
  - Return `false` for null/detached surfaces or missing parameters.
  - Keep split, close, and `text:` semantics unchanged.

- `roastty/tests/abi_harness.c`
  - Add C ABI smoke coverage that `csi` / `esc` without parameters are rejected
    and `csi:` / `esc:` can be invoked through the public ABI.

- Tests in `roastty/src/lib.rs`
  - Cover `csi` and `esc` without parameters returning false.
  - Cover `csi:` and `esc:` returning true with no worker.
  - Cover null/detached surfaces returning false.
  - Cover child PTY delivery for `csi:A` as bytes `1b 5b 41`.
  - Cover child PTY delivery for `esc:d` as bytes `1b 64`.
  - Cover raw parameter bytes are not decoded, for example `csi:\x15` action
    bytes delivering `1b 5b 5c 78 31 35`.
  - Cover empty parameters writing only the prefix bytes.
  - Re-run existing binding-action tests to prove split, close, and `text:`
    semantics did not change.

## Verification

Run:

- `cargo fmt -p roastty`
- `cargo test -p roastty binding_action -- --nocapture`
- `cargo test -p roastty --test abi_harness`
- `cargo fmt -p roastty -- --check`
- `git diff --check`

## Design Review

Codex reviewed the initial Experiment 705 design and approved the technical
scope after two plan fixes. The review confirmed that `csi:` and `esc:` should
use raw `[]const u8` parameters, should not decode Zig string-literal escapes,
should reject missing parameters while accepting empty parameters after the
colon, and should return `true` for attached no-worker surfaces.

The review required adding an explicit no-decode PTY test so an implementation
that accidentally reused the `text:` parser would fail. It also noted upstream's
fixed local buffer for formatting CSI/ESC writes; this design records that
Roastty will use an owned `Vec<u8>` and not preserve that fixed-buffer limit in
this slice. The review also required updating the README provenance tuple before
the plan commit.
