# Experiment 131: Port DECRQM Mode Reports

## Description

Port the first response-producing stream command needed by the mode subsystem:
DECRQM / request mode (`CSI ? Ps $ p`) for DEC-private modes.

Experiments 128-130 completed mode set/reset, basic mode effects, and
DEC-private mode save/restore. Upstream Ghostty also answers mode-status queries
by encoding a DECRPM response and writing it back to the PTY. Roastty already
has the upstream-derived mode report encoder in `roastty/src/terminal/modes.rs`,
but the terminal stream currently has no response-output surface and the CSI
parser currently treats `$` as invalid.

This experiment adds the smallest honest response foundation for Roastty's
terminal core and uses it to implement DEC-private DECRQM:

- parse `CSI ? Ps $ p`;
- route known modes as `RequestMode`;
- route unknown modes as `RequestModeUnknown`;
- encode responses with `ModeState::get_report(...).encode_vt()`;
- store emitted PTY responses in a private terminal response buffer that tests
  can drain.

Do not expose this response buffer through the public C ABI yet. Upstream
Ghostty writes responses through a `write_pty` callback; Roastty's ABI callback
surface and terminal-core integration are not ready for that contract. This
experiment proves the terminal-core parser/executor behavior first. A later ABI
experiment will forward buffered or callback-based PTY responses to the app.

Do not implement device status reports, device attributes, size reports,
XTVERSION, OSC replies, DCS replies, ANSI-mode DECRQM, SGR, OSC, DCS,
alternate-screen, mouse encoding, keypad behavior, public ABI, or non-macOS
behavior here.

## Changes

1. Re-read the upstream source of truth.
   - Use `vendor/ghostty/src/terminal/stream.zig` for DECRQM parsing.
   - Use `vendor/ghostty/src/terminal/stream_terminal.zig::requestMode`,
     `requestModeUnknown`, and `sendModeReport` for terminal execution.
   - Use `vendor/ghostty/src/terminal/modes.zig::Report.encode` as the
     response-format reference.
   - Use Roastty's existing `modes::Report::encode_vt()` rather than adding a
     second formatter.
   - Do not modify `vendor/ghostty/`.

2. Add minimal CSI intermediate support for `$`.
   - Extend `CsiState` with enough intermediate-byte storage to recognize
     `CSI ? Ps $ p`.
   - Keep the parser no-allocation.
   - Do not broadly port all CSI intermediates. The only newly supported
     intermediate in this experiment is `$` when final byte is `p` and private
     marker is `?`.
   - Existing unsupported intermediate forms must remain no-dispatch/no-leak.
   - Existing commands that currently reject `$`, spaces, quotes, or other
     intermediate bytes must not start dispatching accidentally.
   - Any stored CSI intermediate must disable all existing CSI dispatch paths
     unless that command explicitly supports the exact intermediate shape.
     Adding `$` support must not make cursor, erase, mode, tab, scroll, or line
     commands dispatch while silently ignoring the intermediate.
   - Colon-separated CSI params remain invalid.
   - Raw C1 `0x9b` remains out of scope and must keep current raw-UTF-8
     replacement behavior.

3. Add stream actions.
   - Add `Action::RequestMode { mode: modes::Mode }`.
   - Add `Action::RequestModeUnknown { value: u16, ansi: bool }`.
   - Keep both actions internal to the terminal module.
   - Do not add public API or ABI surface.

4. Parse DEC-private DECRQM.
   - Recognize `CSI ? Ps $ p` as DEC-private DECRQM.
   - Require exactly one param.
   - Use `modes::mode_from_int(value, false)`.
   - Dispatch `RequestMode` for known DEC-private modes.
   - Dispatch `RequestModeUnknown { value, ansi: false }` for unknown
     DEC-private modes.
   - Empty params (`CSI ? $ p`) dispatch no action and do not leak final `p`,
     matching upstream's exactly-one-param requirement.
   - Explicit zero (`CSI ? 0 $ p`) dispatches `RequestModeUnknown` for DEC mode
     `0`.
   - Over-capacity params, colon-separated params, wrong private marker, missing
     `$`, extra intermediates, and extra params dispatch no action and do not
     leak the final `p` byte.
   - ANSI-mode DECRQM (`CSI Ps $ p`) remains deferred. Current Roastty should
     keep treating it as unsupported/no-dispatch/no-leak. This matches the
     observed upstream Ghostty source used for this port: the outer `p` branch
     only enters DECRQM for the DEC-private `? $` intermediate shape, even
     though the inner code still contains an ANSI-looking arm.

5. Add a private terminal PTY-response buffer.
   - Add an internal `Vec<u8>` or equivalent response buffer to `Terminal`.
   - Add a private helper such as `write_pty_response(&mut self, bytes: &str)`.
   - Add test-only helpers to inspect and drain the buffer.
   - The helper appends owned response strings to terminal-core state. It has no
     public exposure except `#[cfg(test)]` peek/drain helpers.
   - Treat append as infallible under normal Rust allocation behavior. If the
     implementation ever introduces a fallible writer later, parser state must
     still return to ground before the write is attempted.
   - Before implementing reset behavior, verify whether Roastty currently has an
     `ESC c` / full-reset terminal path. If it exists, clear the response buffer
     on that path. If it does not, record "not applicable" and do not invent
     terminal reset in this experiment.
   - The buffer is terminal-core state only. Do not call ABI callbacks or add C
     exports in this experiment.

6. Execute mode report requests.
   - `RequestMode` calls
     `self.modes.get_report(modes::ModeTag::from_mode(mode)).encode_vt()` and
     appends the encoded bytes to the response buffer.
   - `RequestModeUnknown { value, ansi }` calls
     `self.modes.get_report(modes::ModeTag::new(value, ansi)).encode_vt()` and
     appends the encoded bytes to the response buffer.
   - Multiple requests in one input slice append responses in dispatch order.
   - Response generation must not mutate screen cells, cursor position, dirty
     rows, scrolling margins, or current mode state.

7. Add stream parser tests.
   - `CSI ? 7 $ p` dispatches `RequestMode(Wraparound)`.
   - `CSI ? 2004 $ p` dispatches `RequestMode(BracketedPaste)`.
   - `CSI ? 9999 $ p` dispatches
     `RequestModeUnknown { value: 9999, ansi: false }`.
   - Empty param `CSI ? $ p` dispatches no action and does not leak final `p`.
   - Explicit zero `CSI ? 0 $ p` dispatches unknown DEC mode `0`.
   - Extra params such as `CSI ? 7 ; 8 $ p` dispatch no action and do not leak
     final `p`.
   - Missing `$`, wrong private marker, ANSI `CSI 4 $ p`, invalid colon params,
     and extra intermediate bytes dispatch no action and do not leak final `p`.
   - Existing command families reject the new `$` intermediate instead of
     ignoring it:
     - mode set/reset: `CSI 4 $ h`, `CSI ? 7 $ h`;
     - cursor movement: `CSI 3 $ A`;
     - erase display/line: `CSI 2 $ J`, `CSI 2 $ K`;
     - tab control: `CSI 0 $ W`.
   - Trailing-separator ambiguity is pinned down explicitly: `CSI ? 7 ; $ p`
     must either dispatch no action or be documented as exactly matching
     Roastty's existing finalized-param semantics. Prefer no dispatch/no-leak
     unless implementation proves current parser semantics make that
     inconsistent with nearby CSI behavior.
   - Split-feed DECRQM dispatches correctly, including splits around `$`.
   - Pending invalid UTF-8 emits `U+FFFD` before DECRQM dispatch.
   - Raw C1 `0x9b ? 7 $ p` is not treated as CSI.
   - Handler errors from request-mode actions leave the parser in ground state.

8. Add terminal tests.
   - Default wraparound query `CSI ? 7 $ p` emits `ESC [?7;1$y`.
   - After `CSI ? 7 l`, querying `?7` emits `ESC [?7;2$y`.
   - Bracketed paste query reflects set and reset state.
   - Unknown DEC-private mode query emits `ESC [?9999;0$y`.
   - Multiple queries in one input append multiple responses in order.
   - Draining the test response buffer empties it and returns prior bytes.
   - Formatter output remains unchanged after a DECRQM query; responses must not
     leak into visible terminal content or formatter suffixes.
   - Response generation does not mutate visible cells, cursor position,
     scrolling region, dirty rows, or mode state.
   - Full reset applicability is checked explicitly:
     - if Roastty currently has an `ESC c` / full-reset path, it clears pending
       response output;
     - if not, the result documents that reset behavior was not applicable.
   - No C ABI structs, callbacks, exports, or headers change in this experiment;
     the existing ABI harness continues to pass.
   - Existing parser, terminal, formatter, mode-state, and ABI tests keep
     passing.

9. Verify.
   - Run:

     ```bash
     cargo fmt
     cargo test -p roastty stream_csi_mode
     cargo test -p roastty terminal_stream_csi_mode
     cargo test -p roastty terminal::modes
     cargo test -p roastty terminal::terminal
     cargo test -p roastty stream
     cargo test -p roastty terminal_formatter
     cargo test -p roastty
     ```

   - `cargo fmt` output must be accepted as-is.

10. Independent review.
    - Before implementation, get Codex review of this experiment design.
    - Fix all real design findings before implementation.
    - Record the design-review outcome in this experiment file before
      implementation.
    - Commit the approved design before implementation.
    - After implementation and verification, get Codex review of the completed
      result.
    - Fix all real result findings before proceeding.
    - Commit the approved result separately from the design commit.

11. Record the result.
    - Append `## Result` and `## Conclusion` to this file.
    - Include:
      - exact parser behavior for `CSI ? Ps $ p`;
      - response buffer behavior and reset/drain behavior;
      - exact encoded responses for set, reset, and unknown modes;
      - explicitly deferred ANSI DECRQM, device reports, attributes, size
        reports, ABI forwarding, and other response-producing commands;
      - verification command output summary;
      - Codex design-review outcome;
      - Codex result-review outcome.
    - Update the Issue 801 README experiment index from `Designed` to `Pass`,
      `Partial`, or `Fail`.

## Verification

The experiment passes if:

- real `CSI ? Ps $ p` input dispatches DEC-private mode requests;
- known DEC-private modes encode `Set` or `Reset` responses from current
  `ModeState`;
- unknown DEC-private modes encode `NotRecognized`;
- responses are appended to a private terminal-core PTY response buffer in
  order;
- tests can drain the response buffer;
- response generation does not mutate screen, cursor, dirty rows, margins, or
  mode state;
- unsupported ANSI/malformed/intermediate/raw-C1 forms remain
  no-dispatch/no-leak;
- existing CSI command families reject unsupported intermediates instead of
  dispatching while ignoring them;
- response output is invisible to normal terminal formatting and has no public
  ABI exposure;
- no public ABI, callback, device status, device attribute, size report, OSC,
  DCS, SGR, alternate-screen, mouse, keypad, or non-macOS behavior is added;
- `cargo fmt` and the listed tests pass;
- Codex design and result reviews approve the experiment, or all real findings
  are fixed before proceeding.

The experiment is partial if:

- parser support lands but response output needs a smaller response-buffer
  foundation first;
- response encoding works but the current terminal reset model cannot yet define
  buffer-clear semantics cleanly;
- minimal `$` intermediate support exposes a broader parser-structure issue that
  should be split out before DECRQM lands.

The experiment fails if:

- `CSI ? Ps $ p` still dispatches no action;
- known/unknown mode reports encode the wrong DECRPM status;
- response generation mutates terminal display state;
- malformed forms leak final `p` as printable text;
- the implementation silently adds public ABI forwarding or unrelated
  response-producing commands.

## Design Review

Codex reviewed the initial design and found six real issues:
`logs/codex-review/20260601-071520-673887-last-message.md`.

The design was updated to:

- require empty `CSI ? $ p` to dispatch no action and not leak final `p`, while
  explicit `CSI ? 0 $ p` reports unknown DEC mode `0`;
- require all existing CSI command families to reject unsupported intermediates
  rather than dispatching while silently ignoring `$`;
- frame ANSI `CSI Ps $ p` as deliberately deferred and no-dispatch, matching the
  observed upstream Ghostty branch shape used for this port;
- define the response buffer as private terminal-core state with test-only
  peek/drain helpers and no public ABI exposure;
- require reset-applicability checking before adding any reset behavior;
- require formatter non-leak checks and ABI no-change verification.

Codex re-reviewed the updated design and found no blocking design issues:
`logs/codex-review/20260601-071745-178900-last-message.md`.

Codex also suggested a non-blocking trailing-separator parser test. The design
now requires pinning down `CSI ? 7 ; $ p` behavior during implementation.

The design is approved for implementation.

## Result

**Result:** Pass

Implemented DEC-private DECRQM mode reports in the Roastty terminal core.

The parser now recognizes `CSI ? Ps $ p` as DEC-private mode request input. It
dispatches known DEC-private modes as `Action::RequestMode`, dispatches explicit
unknown DEC-private values such as `CSI ? 9999 $ p` and `CSI ? 0 $ p` as
`Action::RequestModeUnknown`, and leaves empty, malformed, ANSI, wrong-private,
extra-param, colon-param, extra-intermediate, and raw-C1 forms as
no-dispatch/no-leak input. Existing CSI command families now reject `$`
intermediates instead of dispatching while silently ignoring them.

The terminal now has a private terminal-core PTY response buffer. DECRQM
execution encodes reports through the existing upstream-derived
`ModeState::get_report(...).encode_vt()` path and appends the owned bytes to
that buffer in dispatch order. The buffer is test-visible only through
`#[cfg(test)]` peek/drain helpers; no public ABI structs, callbacks, headers, or
exports changed.

Verified encoded response behavior:

- default wraparound query `CSI ? 7 $ p` emits `ESC [?7;1$y`;
- reset wraparound query after `CSI ? 7 l` emits `ESC [?7;2$y`;
- bracketed paste reports set/reset state as `ESC [?2004;1$y` and
  `ESC [?2004;2$y`;
- unknown DEC-private mode `CSI ? 9999 $ p` emits `ESC [?9999;0$y`;
- multiple requests append multiple responses in order;
- draining the test response buffer returns the prior bytes and leaves the
  buffer empty.

Response generation does not mutate visible cells, cursor position, dirty rows,
scrolling margins, formatter output, or mode state. A reset pre-check found no
current Roastty stream-level `ESC c` / full-reset path, so response-buffer reset
clearing was not applicable and no reset behavior was invented in this
experiment.

Explicitly still deferred: ANSI DECRQM, device status reports, device
attributes, size reports, XTVERSION, OSC replies, DCS replies, SGR,
alternate-screen, mouse encoding, keypad behavior, public ABI forwarding, and
non-macOS behavior.

Verification passed:

```bash
cargo fmt
cargo test -p roastty stream_csi_mode
cargo test -p roastty terminal_stream_csi_mode
cargo test -p roastty terminal::modes
cargo test -p roastty terminal::terminal
cargo test -p roastty stream
cargo test -p roastty terminal_formatter
cargo test -p roastty
```

The focused tests passed, and the full suite ended with 1426 unit tests passing,
the ABI harness passing, and 0 doc tests.

Codex reviewed the completed implementation and found no blocking correctness
issues: `logs/codex-review/20260601-072459-955899-last-message.md`.

## Conclusion

Experiment 131 successfully added Roastty's first terminal-core
response-producing stream command without exposing a public ABI contract too
early. DECRQM now has parser coverage, execution coverage, malformed-input
coverage, response-buffer coverage, and formatter/non-mutation coverage.

The next response-producing work can build on this private response foundation,
but forwarding responses to the app/PTY boundary remains a later ABI experiment.
