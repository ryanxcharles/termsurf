# Experiment 159: Port Key Event Value Types

## Description

Port Ghostty's key input value types into Roastty as an internal, testable input
foundation with Roastty naming.

The next keyboard-related subsystem cannot start with live macOS input or public
C ABI. Ghostty's key encoder depends first on a normalized key event model:

- `vendor/ghostty/src/input/key.zig`
  - `KeyEvent`;
  - key `Action`;
  - W3C-style physical `Key` enum;
  - key helper methods such as ASCII mapping, W3C names, keypad detection, and
    macOS `ctrlOrSuper` behavior.
- `vendor/ghostty/src/input/key_mods.zig`
  - packed modifier flags;
  - modifier-side tracking;
  - effective/binding modifiers;
  - macOS option-as-alt translation behavior.

Roastty already has terminal-side Kitty keyboard runtime state from Experiment
155, but it does not yet have the app/input-side key event model that future key
encoding, public key C ABI, and macOS Swift event translation will consume.

This experiment ports only the value types and pure helpers. It must not port
the key encoder, key C ABI, live macOS input, keybindings, modifier remap
config, PTY writes, or Swift integration.

## Changes

1. Add an internal input module.
   - Create `roastty/src/input/mod.rs`.
   - Add `roastty/src/input/key.rs`.
   - Add `roastty/src/input/key_mods.rs`.
   - Register the input module from `roastty/src/lib.rs` or the crate root in
     the narrowest way that lets tests and later terminal/app slices use it.
   - Use `roastty` / `Roastty` names in comments and tests unless citing the
     upstream Ghostty source paths.

2. Port key modifier value types from `input/key_mods.zig`.
   - Add a `Mods` type with the same bit layout as upstream where practical:
     shift, ctrl, alt, super, caps-lock, num-lock, and side bits for shift,
     ctrl, alt, and super.
   - Add a small internal `OptionAsAlt` value type with the same pure choices
     used by upstream (`false`, `true`, `left`, `right`) so modifier translation
     can be tested without importing the config subsystem.
   - Add modifier helper types for:
     - individual modifier identity;
     - left/right side;
     - bindable modifier keys.
   - Add helpers equivalent to:
     - `int()`;
     - `empty()`;
     - equality;
     - `keys()`;
     - `binding()`;
     - `unset()`;
     - `withoutLocks()`;
     - `translation()` for macOS option-as-alt behavior;
     - `ctrl_or_super()` using macOS `super`, not Linux `ctrl`.
   - Keep the implementation macOS-only. Do not preserve live Linux branches.
   - Do not port `RemapSet`, modifier-remap config parsing, or any config parser
     dependency in this experiment. That belongs to the config/keybinding
     subsystem.

3. Port key event value types from `input/key.zig`.
   - Add `KeyAction` with release, press, and repeat values.
   - Add `KeyEvent` with:
     - action;
     - physical key;
     - modifiers;
     - consumed modifiers;
     - composing flag;
     - UTF-8 text bytes;
     - unshifted codepoint.
   - Add `effective_mods()` and a binding hash or equivalent deterministic
     helper that covers the same fields Ghostty uses for bindings.
   - Preserve the distinction between all modifiers and effective modifiers:
     when UTF-8 text exists, consumed modifiers must be removed from the
     effective set.

4. Port the physical key enum and pure helpers.
   - Add the full W3C-derived `Key` enum from `input/key.zig`, renamed to
     Roastty/Rust style.
   - Preserve the upstream integer ordering because later public C ABI and key
     encoder work will depend on stable values.
   - Add helpers equivalent to:
     - `from_ascii()`;
     - `codepoint()`;
     - `keypad()`;
     - `w3c()`;
     - `from_w3c()`;
     - `ctrl_or_super()`;
     - `left_or_right_shift()`;
     - `left_or_right_alt()`.
   - Ensure `from_ascii()` prefers non-keypad keys, matching upstream's
     codepoint-map ordering.
   - Ensure `codepoint()` returns normal printable/keypad codepoints where
     upstream does and `None` for non-printable keys.

5. Add parity tests.
   - Test modifier bit layout against the upstream examples:
     - empty is `0`;
     - shift is bit `0`;
     - representative side bits have stable values.
   - Test modifier helpers:
     - binding modifiers drop lock/side state;
     - `unset()` removes consumed modifiers;
     - `without_locks()` clears caps/num lock only;
     - macOS option-as-alt translation clears the configured option side and
       keeps the non-configured side.
   - Test key event helpers:
     - effective modifiers equal raw modifiers when UTF-8 text is empty;
     - consumed modifiers are removed only when UTF-8 text is non-empty;
     - binding hash changes for key/modifier/unshifted-codepoint changes and
       does not depend on action or UTF-8 text.
   - Test key enum helpers:
     - `from_ascii('0')` returns `Digit0`, not `Numpad0`;
     - `codepoint()` returns representative printable codepoints, keypad
       codepoints, and `None` for non-printable keys;
     - keypad detection distinguishes numpad keys from normal digit keys;
     - every enum value round-trips through `w3c()` and `from_w3c()` unless it
       intentionally has no W3C name;
     - macOS `ctrl_or_super()` returns true for left/right meta keys and false
       for left/right control keys.

6. Keep scope boundaries hard.
   - Do not port `input/key_encode.zig`.
   - Do not add `roastty_key_event_t`, `roastty_key_encoder_t`, or any other
     public key C ABI.
   - Do not wire live Swift/macOS input, app runtime, renderer, PTY process,
     browser overlay, or TermSurf protocol behavior.
   - Do not port keybindings, keymap, command binding, or modifier remap config.
   - Do not add non-macOS platform branches.

7. Independent review.
   - Before implementation, get Codex review of this experiment design.
   - Fix every real finding and re-review until Codex finds no remaining
     blocking design issues.
   - Record the design-review outcome in this experiment file before committing
     the design.
   - After implementation and verification, get Codex review of the completed
     result before committing the result.
   - Do not proceed to the next experiment until the completed result review is
     approved or every real result finding has been fixed and re-reviewed.

## Verification

Run:

```bash
cargo fmt -- roastty/src/lib.rs roastty/src/input/mod.rs roastty/src/input/key.rs roastty/src/input/key_mods.rs
cargo test -p roastty key_event
cargo test -p roastty key_mods
cargo test -p roastty
```

Required coverage:

- New input modules compile without public ABI changes.
- Modifier bit layout and helper behavior match the upstream tests named in this
  experiment.
- Key event effective-modifier and binding-hash behavior matches Ghostty's field
  choices.
- Physical key enum ordering is stable and documented with tests for total
  variant count, `KeyAction` discriminants (`release = 0`, `press = 1`,
  `repeat = 2`), and boundary/sentinel discriminants from each upstream key enum
  section.
- W3C helper tests cover every enum value that has a W3C name.
- `codepoint()` helper tests cover normal printable keys, keypad keys, and
  non-printable keys.
- ASCII mapping prefers non-keypad keys.
- macOS-only `ctrl_or_super()` behavior uses `super` / `meta`, not `ctrl`.
- Existing Kitty keyboard runtime tests still pass.
- Existing mouse, terminal, formatter, and ABI harness tests still pass through
  the full suite.
- Codex design review and result review both pass before moving to the next
  stage.

## Non-Negotiable Invariants

- Use Roastty names in implementation-facing comments, tests, and modules.
- Preserve the upstream key enum integer order for later ABI compatibility.
- Preserve modifier bit layout where practical and test the layout.
- Keep option-as-alt as a small internal input value type in this experiment; do
  not import or port config parsing to support it.
- Keep this experiment pure and internal: no public C ABI, live input, key
  encoding, PTY writes, Swift integration, renderer behavior, browser overlay,
  TermSurf protocol behavior, keybindings, or config remapping.
- Keep the port macOS-only. Do not preserve Linux behavior gates.
- Run `cargo fmt` and accept its output.
- Pass Codex design and result reviews before moving to the next stage.

## Failure Criteria

This experiment fails if:

- public `ghostty_*` or compatibility key ABI names are introduced;
- key enum integer values diverge from upstream ordering without a documented
  reason and test coverage;
- `KeyAction` discriminants do not match upstream ordering;
- modifier bit layout differs from upstream in a way that would break future ABI
  or key encoding work;
- option-as-alt translation pulls in config parsing or broader config behavior;
- `codepoint()` is omitted or diverges from upstream printable/keypad behavior;
- effective modifiers ignore consumed modifiers when UTF-8 text exists;
- ASCII mapping returns keypad keys before non-keypad keys;
- macOS `ctrl_or_super()` behavior uses Linux control-key semantics;
- key encoder, key C ABI, live input, PTY writes, Swift/app/runtime integration,
  renderer behavior, browser overlay, TermSurf protocol behavior, keybindings,
  config remapping, or non-macOS platform behavior is added;
- existing Kitty keyboard, mouse, terminal, formatter, or ABI tests regress;
- the design or result proceeds without the required Codex review gate.

## Codex Design Review

Codex reviewed the initial design before implementation.

Initial review artifacts:

- Prompt: `logs/codex-review/20260601-135827-873565-prompt.md`
- Result: `logs/codex-review/20260601-135827-873565-last-message.md`

Codex found three real design issues:

- `Key::codepoint()` was missing from the value-type foundation even though the
  future key encoder depends on it.
- `translation()` needed an internal option-as-alt value type so the experiment
  would not accidentally pull in config parsing.
- enum-order verification needed to be stronger than representative values
  because the key enum will later be ABI-sensitive.

All three findings were fixed.

Clean design re-review artifacts:

- Prompt: `logs/codex-review/20260601-140030-144817-prompt.md`
- Result: `logs/codex-review/20260601-140030-144817-last-message.md`

Codex found no remaining blockers and approved the experiment for
implementation.

## Result

**Result:** Pass

Experiment 159 ports the internal key input value-type foundation into Roastty
without wiring it to live input, key encoding, public ABI, PTY writes, or config
remapping.

Implemented:

- `roastty/src/input/mod.rs`
  - registers the internal input modules;
  - keeps the currently-unwired foundation quiet with a module-level `dead_code`
    allowance until later experiments consume it.
- `roastty/src/input/key_mods.rs`
  - adds `Mod`, `Side`, `OptionAsAlt`, `ModSides`, `ModKeys`, and `Mods`;
  - preserves the upstream modifier bit layout for shift, ctrl, alt, super,
    caps-lock, num-lock, and side bits;
  - ports modifier helpers for integer layout, empty checks, bindable keys,
    binding modifiers, consumed-modifier removal, lock removal, macOS
    option-as-alt translation, and macOS ctrl-or-super behavior.
- `roastty/src/input/key.rs`
  - adds `KeyAction`, `KeyEvent`, and the full 176-value physical `Key` enum in
    upstream order;
  - ports effective-modifier behavior and a deterministic binding hash over the
    same binding-relevant fields;
  - ports physical-key helpers for ASCII mapping, codepoint lookup, keypad
    detection, W3C names, W3C lookup, macOS ctrl-or-super behavior, shift-side
    detection, and alt-side detection.
- `roastty/src/lib.rs`
  - registers the internal `input` module.

The experiment deliberately did not port key encoding, key C ABI, live
Swift/macOS input, app runtime wiring, renderer behavior, PTY writes, browser
overlay behavior, TermSurf protocol behavior, keybindings, keymap, or
modifier-remap config parsing.

Verification:

- `cargo fmt -- roastty/src/lib.rs roastty/src/input/mod.rs roastty/src/input/key.rs roastty/src/input/key_mods.rs`
- `cargo test -p roastty key_event` — 3 passed
- `cargo test -p roastty key_mods` — 5 passed
- `cargo test -p roastty` — 1757 unit tests passed, ABI harness passed, doc
  tests passed
- `rg -n "ghostty|Ghostty|ghostty_" roastty/src/input roastty/src/lib.rs` — no
  matches

## Codex Result Review

Codex reviewed the completed implementation and recorded result before commit.

Initial result-review artifacts:

- Prompt: `logs/codex-review/20260601-140546-223511-prompt.md`
- Result: `logs/codex-review/20260601-140546-223511-last-message.md`

Codex found one real result issue:

- `Key::from_w3c()` accepted exact W3C strings and snake-case names, but did not
  preserve upstream's normalization for forms such as `digit0` and `numpad0`.

The issue was fixed by adding W3C-to-snake normalization before lookup and test
coverage for `Digit0`, `digit0`, `Numpad0`, `numpad0`, `KeyA`, `key_a`, and an
invalid string.

Clean result re-review artifacts:

- Prompt: `logs/codex-review/20260601-140850-577523-prompt.md`
- Result: `logs/codex-review/20260601-140850-577523-last-message.md`

Codex found no remaining blockers and approved the result for commit.

## Conclusion

Roastty now has the pure key input model needed before the key encoder and key C
ABI can be ported. The next keyboard slice can build on this by porting the pure
key encoder, still without adding live macOS input or PTY process wiring until
the encoder is independently verified.
