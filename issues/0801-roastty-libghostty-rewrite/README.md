# Issue 801: Reimplement libghostty as libroastty

## Goal

Reimplement the remaining `libghostty` library surface and behavior as
`libroastty`, a Rust library with Roastty naming throughout. The end state is a
macOS-only terminal implementation with Ghostty feature parity before TermSurf
browser-overlay features are added.

## Background

Issue 800 created the Roastty foundation:

- a top-level Cargo workspace containing `webtui`, `roamium`, and `roastty`
- a new `roastty/` Rust crate
- the first `roastty_*` C ABI skeleton
- `roastty/include/roastty.h`
- a small configuration subset exposed through `roastty_config_get`
- an ABI inventory comparing upstream Ghostty's C surface to Roastty's current
  skeleton

That issue also corrected an important naming mistake: Roastty is a faithful
Rust adaptation of Ghostty, but it is not allowed to expose `ghostty_*` app or
ABI names. Public functions, app-facing symbols, crate names, comments, and
documentation inside the implementation should use `roastty` / `Roastty`. The
word `ghostty` should appear only when citing the upstream project, vendored
source paths, research notes, or attribution.

This issue continues from that foundation and owns the rest of the library
rewrite.

## Scope

This issue is intentionally broad: it tracks the remaining work needed to turn
`roastty/` from an ABI skeleton into a real terminal library. The work must be
implemented incrementally through reviewed experiments, but the target is the
entire remaining `libghostty` behavior needed by the macOS app.

Roastty is macOS-only. The rewrite should not preserve Ghostty's Linux, FreeBSD,
Windows, GTK, Wayland, X11, OpenGL, or other non-macOS gates as live
implementation paths. When upstream Ghostty has code shaped like "if Linux do
this, else if macOS do that," the Roastty port should keep the macOS behavior
and omit the other branches unless an experiment documents a specific reason to
keep a stub for testability or source comparison.

The rewrite includes, at minimum:

- complete configuration loading, parsing, validation, finalization,
  diagnostics, key lookup, keybindings, and runtime config updates
- app/runtime lifecycle behavior: init, tick, focus, quit confirmation, color
  scheme changes, global keybinds, mailbox/event delivery, and surface
  coordination
- surface lifecycle behavior: creation, inherited config, draw/refresh hooks,
  sizing, content scale, display ID, focus, occlusion, quicklook, inspector
  integration, split coordination, selection reads, and text reads
- terminal core behavior: parser, screen/grid, scrollback, cursor state, style
  state, CSI/OSC/DCS handling, SGR, mouse modes, selection, reflow, input
  encoding, Kitty keyboard behavior, and Kitty graphics behavior
- PTY and IO behavior: macOS shell/process spawn, read/write loops, resize,
  foreground process ID, TTY name, process exit, and platform-specific macOS
  behavior
- rendering state and renderer boundary: enough structure to preserve Ghostty's
  rendering model while adapting it to Rust, with Metal renderer parity as a
  later subsystem slice
- font and text stack: CoreText integration, shaping, fallback, metrics, glyph
  atlas behavior, emoji behavior, and Nerd Font handling
- clipboard, keyboard translation, mouse input, IME/preedit, and platform input
  edge cases
- the renamed macOS Swift frontend integration once the Rust library has enough
  behavior to host it
- Rust replacements for the third-party libraries Ghostty depends on (see
  **Dependency replacements** below) — Roastty does not vendor or link Ghostty's
  Zig or C packages; each is provided in Rust (a crate or a from-scratch port
  per the hybrid policy)

### Dependency replacements

Roastty does **not** vendor, link, or carry forward Ghostty's third-party Zig or
C packages. The capability each provides is **provided in Rust**, in scope for
this issue. How that capability is provided follows a **hybrid policy by
layer**:

- **Crate-eligible (commodity primitives).** Where a component is a well-solved,
  general-purpose primitive with **no byte-for-byte requirement** — compression,
  image decoding, UTF-8 validation, regex, fuzzy matching, an event loop — a
  mature, well-maintained Rust crate may be used. Behavioral faithfulness (it
  decodes the same image, matches the same URL) is the bar, not bit-identical
  output.
- **From-scratch (identity / fidelity).** Where a component is part of Ghostty's
  own behavior/identity, or is constrained by a **fidelity test** (a golden
  fixture that demands byte-exact output), it is reimplemented as first-class
  Roastty code. Examples: the sprite path rasterizer (its glyph PNGs are
  compared byte-for-byte) and the Unicode tables (must match Ghostty's exact
  property/grapheme semantics).

So **byte-for-byte equivalence with the original C/Zig is required only where a
test encodes it**; otherwise correct behavior suffices. Each dependency's
crate-vs-from-scratch choice (and, for a crate, which one) is decided and
recorded in that dependency's own experiment, under the standard process (design
→ review → implement → test → review).

The macOS-only constraint above still applies: dependencies that exist solely
for Linux/GTK/Wayland/X11/OpenGL or non-macOS build paths are out of scope, and
capabilities already supplied by macOS **system frameworks** (CoreText,
CoreGraphics, etc., reached via `objc2` bindings) are bound, not reimplemented.

Zig-origin libraries:

- **uucode** — _from-scratch._ Unicode property, grapheme-break, and width
  tables used across the terminal and font layers. Roastty Unicode tables
  generated from the UCD, matching Ghostty's exact property semantics (crates
  like `unicode-width`/`unicode-segmentation` may cross-check, not replace).
- **z2d** — _fidelity decision (open)._ 2D vector rasterization, used only for
  the sprite font's anti-aliased path glyphs and the CPU debug overlay. Because
  the glyph PNGs are compared byte-for-byte, this is the one rasterizer subject
  to the fidelity rule — resolved in its own experiment (byte-exact port vs. a
  Rust rasterizer with regenerated fixtures). The exact-fill sprite path needs
  no rasterizer and is already ported.
- **libxev** — _crate-eligible._ The async event loop. A Rust event-loop crate
  (e.g. `mio`/`polling` over kqueue, or `tokio`) may drive the PTY read/write
  loops and timers; no byte-exact requirement (macOS only — the
  epoll/io_uring/IOCP backends are not ported).
- **zf** — _crate-eligible._ Fuzzy matching for list/command filtering (e.g.
  `nucleo`/`fuzzy-matcher`).
- **zig-objc** — _done._ Objective-C runtime bindings — already satisfied by
  `objc2`.
- **vaxis** — TUI toolkit; used only by the `+list-*` CLI tools, not the
  library. Addressed only if/when those CLIs are ported.
- **zig-js** — WASM/JS interop; not part of the macOS library (out of scope).

C-origin libraries (mostly crate-eligible — none carries a byte-exact fixture):

- **wuffs / libpng / zlib** — _crate-eligible._ Image decoding (Kitty graphics
  PNG) and DEFLATE (e.g. `png`, `flate2`/`miniz_oxide`).
- **oniguruma** — _crate-eligible._ Regular expressions for link/URL detection
  (e.g. the `regex` crate; confirm the flavor covers Ghostty's link patterns).
- **simdutf** — _crate-eligible._ Fast UTF-8 validation/transcoding (e.g.
  `simdutf8`, or `std`).
- **highway** — _crate-eligible / subsumed._ SIMD primitives — mostly absorbed
  by the crates above or `std::simd`; reimplemented only where still needed.
- **sentry** — _crate-eligible._ Crash reporting (app-level, optional; e.g. the
  `sentry` crate) if retained.
- **dcimgui** — _crate-eligible._ Dear ImGui for the inspector UI (e.g.
  `imgui-rs`/`egui`) if the inspector is retained.
- **glslang / spirv-cross** — _crate-eligible / deferred._ GLSL→SPIR-V→MSL
  shader translation (e.g. `naga`). Needed only if Roastty translates shaders at
  runtime; the Metal path uses precompiled shaders, so deferred unless a runtime
  need appears.
- **harfbuzz / freetype / fontconfig** — _system framework._ Shaping,
  rasterization, font discovery — superseded on macOS by CoreText/CoreGraphics
  (bound via `objc2`), so not reimplemented; fontconfig is Linux-only.

Out of scope (non-macOS): gobject/GTK, gtk4-layer-shell, wayland (and
protocols), opengl, libintl, and the Android/SDK packages.

## Subsystem checklist

A living, file-verified progress tracker for the whole rewrite: every libghostty
subsystem and every reimplemented dependency. **As items are completed, check
them off** (`[ ]` → `[x]`). An item is only checked when it is a complete,
faithful, tested port; partial subsystems leave the finished sub-items checked
and the rest unchecked with a note. Keep this in sync as experiments land — the
per-experiment detail lives in the [Experiments](#experiments) index below.

## Architecture

Roastty should be a faithful macOS adaptation of Ghostty's architecture, not a
new terminal emulator invented beside it. The implementation may use idiomatic
Rust where Rust gives a clearer or safer representation, but the port should
preserve Ghostty's subsystem boundaries and macOS behavior unless an experiment
explicitly records why a different design is required.

The public library boundary is `libroastty`:

- exported C functions use `roastty_*`
- public headers use Roastty names
- Rust crates/modules use Roastty names where product identity is visible
- compatibility shims named `ghostty_*` are not allowed
- upstream Ghostty names are allowed only when describing the source material,
  vendored paths, test provenance, or attribution

The target is macOS-only, not macOS-first. Cross-platform terminal parity is not
part of this issue and should not shape the internal architecture.

## Test Parity

The rewrite must include tests, not only implementation code. Each subsystem
experiment must identify the relevant upstream Ghostty tests, fixtures, or
behavioral checks and either:

- port those tests into the Roastty Rust test suite,
- create equivalent Roastty tests when a direct port is not appropriate, or
- explicitly document why a specific upstream test cannot be automated yet and
  what manual or future infrastructure would be required.

Feature parity is not considered achieved for a subsystem until both the
implementation and its corresponding tests or documented test-equivalent checks
exist.

## Process

This is a long parent issue. Do not attempt a big-bang rewrite. Each experiment
must choose one coherent subsystem slice, implement it, test it, record the
result, and let that result determine the next experiment.

Every experiment must follow the current project process:

- design exactly one experiment at a time
- have the experiment design reviewed by another AI agent before implementation
- fix all real design issues found by that review
- commit the reviewed experiment design separately
- implement and verify the experiment
- have the completed result reviewed by another AI agent before proceeding
- fix all real result issues found by that review
- commit the experiment result separately

No experiment may proceed to the next stage until the required review passes.

## Agent Provenance

Every experiment records, in TOML frontmatter at the top of its file, which AI
agent performed each role: the **implementer** (designs, writes, and records the
experiment) and the two review gates (**design review** and **result review**).
Each role logs `agent`, `model`, and `reasoning` (effort level), so the record
is machine-parseable for later comparison. Design review and result review are
independent passes from implementation; from Experiment 223 the reviewer is also
a different agent than the implementer.

- **Experiments 1–222:** designed, reviewed, implemented, and re-reviewed
  entirely by **Codex (GPT-5.5, medium)** — all three roles.
- **Experiment 223 onward:** the implementer switches to **Claude (Opus 4.8,
  high)** as a controlled trial; both review gates remain **Codex (GPT-5.5,
  medium)**. This is the first time implementer and reviewer differ.

Each `## Experiments` line is also tagged after its status with the agents for
all three roles, in order — `implementer/design-review/result-review` (e.g.
`— **Pass** · Codex/Codex/Codex`, or `· Claude/Codex/Codex` from Experiment 223
on) — so the implementer and reviewers are scannable from the index. The tags
must match that experiment's `[implementer]`, `[review.design]`, and
`[review.result]` frontmatter.

Frontmatter schema:

```toml
+++
[implementer]
agent = "..."      # codex | claude-code
model = "..."      # gpt-5.5 | claude-opus-4-8
reasoning = "..."  # effort level: medium | high

[review.design]    # same three keys
[review.result]    # same three keys
+++
```

## Experiment Granularity

Early experiments may be small when they establish correctness-critical
foundation: page storage, managed metadata, pin tracking, parser state,
formatters, selection, and row/cell mutation primitives. These areas are allowed
to advance one primitive or one control sequence at a time because bugs are hard
to localize and can corrupt later layers.

Once the relevant foundation exists, experiments should grow to coherent
subsystem slices rather than one tiny behavior at a time. Prefer grouping
related features when they share the same implementation surface and can be
verified together, for example:

- remaining related CSI row/scroll mutations;
- SGR execution plus styled printing;
- OSC parsing and action dispatch;
- mouse modes plus mouse encoding;
- PTY spawn/read/write/resize;
- macOS input/key translation.

The goal is not to maximize experiment count. The goal is to preserve
reviewable, testable progress toward full `libroastty` parity. If an experiment
can cover a larger subsystem without blurring failure diagnosis or weakening
tests, choose the larger subsystem.

### Sizing each experiment

Size each experiment by **risk, not by count or line total**. Choose the largest
slice that still satisfies all of:

1. **One coherent implementation surface** — the change lives in one
   subsystem/file cluster, not spread across unrelated layers.
2. **Predictable tests** — you can write the experiment's tests and reasonably
   expect them to pass before implementing. If you cannot predict the outcome,
   the slice carries too much uncertainty.
3. **At most one novel mechanism** — only one genuinely new or uncertain
   technique per experiment (a new unsafe pattern, a new framework binding, a
   new ownership model). Two independent unknowns means two experiments.
4. **Localized failure** — if it fails, the cause narrows to a single behavior.

If a candidate breaks any of these, split it at the point of uncertainty. If it
satisfies all of them and a sibling behavior shares the same surface and tests
with no independent risk, fold the sibling in rather than spending a separate
design + review + result cycle on it.

When unsure, bias by risk: prefer the **larger** slice for mechanical, low-risk
work (leaf control-sequence handlers, value types, lookup tables, scalar ABI
getters), and the **smaller** slice for high-risk work (unsafe memory,
ownership/lifetime, reflow, framework lifecycle — anything whose bug corrupts
later layers).

The remaining subsystems — font/CoreText, the live Metal renderer, config
loading, PTY/termio, and the Swift frontend — involve macOS framework
integration that is harder to test one-to-one than the terminal control-sequence
tail. Treat those as higher-risk and keep their slices smaller even though they
are past the correctness-critical foundation.

## Non-Goals

- Do not add TermSurf browser overlay behavior in this issue. Roastty must first
  become a real terminal foundation.
- Do not preserve or expose `ghostty_*` compatibility ABI names.
- Do not rewrite the vendored Ghostty source. The vendor copy is source material
  and attribution context.
- Do not retrofit older issue documents to the one-file-per-experiment
  structure.
- Do not implement Linux, FreeBSD, Windows, GTK, Wayland, X11, OpenGL, or other
  non-macOS support paths.
- Do not keep platform abstraction layers merely because upstream Ghostty has
  them. Keep an abstraction only when it is useful for Roastty's macOS design or
  for tests.

## Closure Criteria

This issue can close when `libroastty` implements the remaining macOS library
behavior required by the renamed app with test coverage or documented
test-equivalent checks for each ported subsystem. At that point Roastty should
be ready for a follow-up issue focused on the Swift app integration and then,
later, TermSurf browser overlay integration.
