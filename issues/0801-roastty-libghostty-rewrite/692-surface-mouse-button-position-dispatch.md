# Experiment 692: Surface Mouse Button Position Dispatch

## Description

Experiment 689 added state-only mouse callback foundations:
`roastty_surface_mouse_button`, `roastty_surface_mouse_pos`,
`roastty_surface_mouse_scroll`, and `roastty_surface_mouse_pressure` validate
inputs and remember the latest frontend mouse state, but button callbacks still
return `false` even when terminal mouse reporting is active.

Upstream Ghostty encodes terminal mouse reports from button and cursor-position
callbacks when the terminal has mouse reporting enabled, queues the encoded
bytes to termio, and returns `true` for consumed button events. Roastty already
has the terminal mouse encoder, terminal mouse-mode tracking, surface pixel
size, content scale, and worker write queue. This experiment wires the first
dispatch slice: button press/release and pointer motion.

This does not implement scroll dispatch, alternate-scroll cursor-key behavior,
selection clearing while reporting, mouse shift-capture policy, or frontend pane
selection side effects. Those remain separate experiments because they involve
scroll normalization, selection ownership, and frontend policy beyond the
button/position report path.

## Changes

- `roastty/src/lib.rs`
  - Add surface mouse dispatch helpers that:
    - derive a `mouse_encode::Geometry` from the current `Surface` size, using
      `width_px` / `height_px` as the screen size, existing `cell_width_px` /
      `cell_height_px` when available, and otherwise a safe nonzero cell size
      derived from the attached worker terminal's current columns/rows or the
      `Surface::pty_size()` fallback;
    - read the attached worker terminal's current `mouse_event` mode and mouse
      format state through `with_termio`;
    - build `mouse_encode::Event` values for button press/release callbacks and
      pointer motion callbacks;
    - for motion callbacks, include the first currently pressed mouse button
      when one exists so Button-mode drag motion can be reported; otherwise use
      `button = None` for buttonless Any-mode motion;
    - pass `any_button_pressed` from `SurfaceMouseState` and keep a per-surface
      last-cell cache for motion deduplication;
    - queue nonempty encoded reports to the termio worker.
  - Extend `SurfaceMouseState` with the dispatch-only state needed by the
    encoder, such as `last_reported_cell`.
  - Change `Surface::mouse_button` so valid attached-surface button events:
    - still update stored button/modifier state;
    - encode and queue a report when terminal mouse reporting accepts the event;
    - return `true` only when a report was queued.
  - Change `Surface::mouse_pos` so valid attached-surface finite positions:
    - update stored position/modifier state;
    - encode and queue a motion report when the terminal's mouse reporting mode
      accepts it;
    - remain a `void` ABI callback.
  - Preserve existing no-op behavior for null surfaces, detached surfaces,
    invalid enum values, nonfinite positions, missing workers, missing terminal
    mouse reporting, and worker write failures except that a worker write error
    is recorded through the existing termio error path.
  - Keep `roastty_surface_mouse_scroll` and `roastty_surface_mouse_pressure`
    state-only in this experiment.
  - Add focused tests for:
    - no report and `false` return when mouse reporting is disabled;
    - press/release reports and `true` return when reporting is enabled;
    - motion reports in Any mode and no motion reports in Normal mode;
    - Button-mode drag motion reports carry the pressed button identity;
    - last-cell motion deduplication;
    - geometry works after the normal `roastty_surface_set_size` path with an
      attached worker even when `columns`, `rows`, `cell_width_px`, and
      `cell_height_px` remain unset on the surface;
    - invalid/detached/no-worker cases remain safe no-ops;
    - worker queue failure records an error without panicking.

- `roastty/tests/abi_harness.c`
  - Keep the existing surface mouse smoke calls compiling against the same ABI.
    No C ABI shape change is expected for this experiment.

## Verification

Run:

- `cargo fmt -p roastty`
- `cargo test -p roastty surface_mouse -- --nocapture`
- `cargo test -p roastty mouse -- --nocapture`
- `cargo test -p roastty --test abi_harness`
- `cargo fmt -p roastty -- --check`
- `git diff --check`

## Design Review

Codex approved the revised design after two fixes: motion dispatch now preserves
the first pressed button for Button-mode drag reports, and geometry derivation
no longer depends only on surface grid/cell fields populated by the frontend.
The test plan now covers both cases.
