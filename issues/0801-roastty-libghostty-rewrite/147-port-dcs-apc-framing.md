# Experiment 147: Port DCS and APC Framing

## Description

Port Ghostty's DCS and APC string framing into Roastty's terminal stream.

Roastty currently handles CSI and OSC, but `ESC P ... ESC \` DCS strings and
`ESC _ ... ESC \` APC strings are not first-class stream states. That is a
correctness gap: until these states exist, DCS/APC payload bytes can fall back
to ordinary printable text after the introducer is ignored.

This experiment adds the stream-level framing and terminal no-op runtime needed
before later experiments implement the command-specific DCS/APC protocols:

- DCS DECRQSS / XTGETTCAP / tmux control-mode parsing and responses;
- APC Kitty graphics parsing and responses.

The goal here is not to implement those protocols yet. The goal is to make
Roastty correctly recognize, contain, and consume DCS/APC string bodies without
leaking their bytes into terminal content, while exposing the same event shape
Ghostty's stream uses for future protocol handlers.

## Changes

1. Extend `roastty/src/terminal/stream.rs` actions:
   - Add `Action::DcsHook { value }`.
   - Add `Action::DcsPut { byte }`.
   - Add `Action::DcsUnhook`.
   - Add `Action::ApcStart`.
   - Add `Action::ApcPut { byte }`.
   - Add `Action::ApcEnd`.
   - Add a typed DCS hook value matching Ghostty's event shape:
     - `intermediates`: up to four collected bytes from `0x20..=0x2f`;
     - `params`: up to the existing fixed CSI capacity, with semicolon-only
       parameter separation;
     - `final_byte`.
   - Do not add a separate DCS private field or separator list. Ghostty exposes
     DCS hook metadata as intermediates, params, and final byte only.

2. Extend escape recognition:
   - `ESC P` enters DCS entry state.
   - `ESC _` enters APC string state.
   - C1 DCS/APC bytes are out of scope for this experiment because the current
     Roastty stream has focused on 7-bit escape forms. Add tests documenting
     that the implemented target is 7-bit framing.

3. Implement DCS framing:
   - Parse DCS header bytes with explicit Ghostty-compatible DCS state-machine
     rules, not by reusing CSI parsing wholesale:
     - DCS entry ignores C0 controls and DEL.
     - `0x20..=0x2f` from entry enters DCS intermediate and collects
       intermediates.
     - `:` from entry enters DCS ignore.
     - digits and `;` from entry enter DCS param and build semicolon-separated
       `u16` params.
     - `<`, `=`, `>`, and `?` from entry enter DCS param through collect
       behavior, matching Ghostty's parser table.
     - in DCS param, digits and `;` continue param parsing.
     - in DCS param, `:` and `<`..`?` enter DCS ignore.
     - in DCS param, `0x20..=0x2f` enters DCS intermediate and collects
       intermediates.
     - in DCS intermediate, more `0x20..=0x2f` bytes are collected.
     - in DCS intermediate, `0x30..=0x3f` enters DCS ignore.
     - any final byte `0x40..=0x7e` from entry, param, or intermediate enters
       DCS passthrough and may dispatch `Action::DcsHook` if metadata capacity
       was not exceeded.
   - On a valid final byte, dispatch `Action::DcsHook` and enter DCS
     passthrough.
   - While in DCS passthrough, dispatch `Action::DcsPut` for payload bytes.
   - ESC exits DCS passthrough and dispatches `Action::DcsUnhook`. `ESC \` is
     the common ST spelling, but Ghostty's parser exits DCS on ESC before
     processing the byte after ESC. Therefore `ESC X`, `ESC P`, `ESC [` and
     other ESC-prefixed sequences also end the prior DCS before the next escape
     path is interpreted.
   - Do not terminate DCS on BEL. BEL inside DCS payload is delivered as
     `DcsPut { byte: 0x07 }`, matching the VT parser model.
   - Unknown DCS command identity does not matter at this layer. The stream
     still emits hook/put/unhook so a later DCS protocol handler can decide
     whether to ignore or handle it.
   - Malformed DCS header forms enter an ignore state that consumes bytes until
     the next ESC transition and dispatches no DCS actions.
   - Exceeding param or intermediate capacity drops the hook action and keeps
     the string contained until ESC, matching Ghostty's "too many params" DCS
     behavior.
   - Payload bytes must never print as terminal content.

4. Implement APC framing:
   - `ESC _` dispatches `Action::ApcStart` and enters APC string state.
   - While in APC string state, dispatch `Action::ApcPut` for payload bytes.
   - ESC exits APC and dispatches `Action::ApcEnd`. As with DCS, `ESC \` is the
     common ST spelling, but `ESC X`, `ESC P`, `ESC [` and other ESC-prefixed
     sequences also end the prior APC before the next escape path is
     interpreted.
   - BEL inside APC payload is delivered as `ApcPut { byte: 0x07 }`.
   - Unknown APC command identity is intentionally not interpreted here.
   - Payload bytes must never print as terminal content.

5. Extend terminal runtime behavior:
   - `TerminalStreamHandler` ignores all DCS/APC actions for now.
   - This matches Ghostty's current terminal runtime shape for DCS actions.
     Ghostty already routes APC into a Kitty graphics handler, so Roastty's APC
     no-op is an explicit deferment until a later Kitty graphics experiment.
   - Ignoring these actions must not mutate display cells, cursor position,
     dirty flags, modes, or PTY responses.

6. Add tests:
   - Stream DCS tests:
     - `ESC P $ q m ESC \` dispatches hook with intermediate `$`, final `q`,
       payload byte `m`, then unhook.
     - `ESC P + q 536D ESC \` dispatches hook with intermediate `+`, final `q`,
       payload bytes, then unhook.
     - DCS with params, semicolon separators, multiple intermediates, and a
       final byte preserves the parsed Ghostty-shaped hook metadata.
     - DCS colon from entry and colon from param enter ignore and do not
       dispatch DCS actions.
     - DCS `<`..`?` before params follows Ghostty's entry collect path, while
       `<`..`?` after params enters ignore.
     - DCS with too many params or too many intermediates remains contained and
       dispatches no hook.
     - BEL inside DCS payload dispatches `DcsPut { byte: 0x07 }` rather than
       terminating.
     - malformed DCS header consumes through ESC without dispatching DCS actions
       or printing payload/final bytes.
     - `ESC P ... ESC X B` dispatches `DcsUnhook`, does not print DCS payload,
       and handles the `ESC X` path without leaking `X` as printable text.
     - split-feed DCS sequences preserve state across `next_slice` calls.
   - Stream APC tests:
     - `ESC _ G payload ESC \` dispatches start, put bytes, and end.
     - unknown APC payload dispatches the same framing actions; protocol
       interpretation is out of scope.
     - BEL inside APC payload dispatches `ApcPut { byte: 0x07 }`.
     - `ESC _ ... ESC [ ... B` dispatches `ApcEnd`, does not print APC payload,
       and handles the next escape path without leaking APC bytes.
     - split-feed APC sequences preserve state across `next_slice` calls.
   - No-leak tests:
     - DCS/APC payloads surrounded by printable bytes print only the surrounding
       printable bytes.
     - After DCS/APC termination, normal printing resumes.
     - malformed DCS and APC sequences interrupted by ESC do not leak payload or
       final bytes.
     - if a handler returns an error during DCS/APC hook/put/end actions, the
       stream returns to a recoverable state before the error is surfaced, and a
       later printable byte can be processed normally.
   - Terminal tests:
     - DCS/APC sequences do not mutate visible display content or PTY response
       state.

## Verification

   cargo test -p roastty stream_apc
   ```

3. Run the full Roastty test suite:

   ```bash
   cargo test -p roastty
   ```

## Design Review

Codex reviewed the initial design and agreed the scope was right, but did not
approve until several Ghostty parser semantics were fixed:

- DCS/APC strings exit on ESC, not only on complete ST (`ESC \`).
- DCS hook metadata must match Ghostty's `intermediates`, `params`, and `final`
  shape rather than a CSI-like private/intermediate/separator shape.
- DCS header parsing must use explicit DCS entry/param/intermediate/ignore rules
  instead of "similar to CSI."
- APC terminal no-op behavior is an intentional Roastty deferment, not a match
  for Ghostty's APC runtime, which already feeds Kitty graphics.
- No-leak tests must include ESC interruption and handler-error recovery cases.

Codex approved the revised design after those updates. No remaining required
design fixes.

Implementation note from Codex: be precise in tests around `ESC X` after
DCS/APC. Ghostty treats `ESC X` as SOS/PM/APC string entry; Roastty's narrower
7-bit APC scope may consume it as unsupported. Either is acceptable only if the
test expectation explicitly pins which bytes print or remain contained.
