# Experiment 703: Binding Action Close Surface

## Description

Experiment 702 added `roastty_surface_binding_action` for the split action
strings Roastty could already forward through the runtime action callback.
Upstream Ghostty also supports `close_surface` through the same
`Binding.Action.parse` / `Surface.performBindingAction` path:

- `close_surface` has no parameter;
- `performBindingAction` calls `Surface.close()`;
- `Surface.close()` forwards the computed confirm-close state to the runtime
  surface close callback;
- after the switch completes, `performBindingAction` returns `true`.

Roastty already has the pieces needed for this one action:

- `roastty_surface_request_close`;
- `Surface::request_close`;
- confirm-close policy computation;
- close callback tests.

This experiment extends the existing binding-action foundation to support
`close_surface`:

- parse `close_surface` with no parameter;
- reject `close_surface:*` as malformed, matching upstream void-action parsing;
- invoke `Surface::request_close`;
- return `true` for attached surfaces after a parsed `close_surface`, even when
  the runtime has no close callback, matching upstream's runtime-optional close
  forwarding;
- return `false` for null or detached surfaces before invoking anything.

This does not implement `close_tab`, `close_window`, `quit`, app-scoped actions,
full `Binding.Action` parsing, frontend split/tab/window mutation, or surface
deallocation from the binding action itself.

## Changes

- `roastty/src/lib.rs`
  - Replace the split-only parsed action representation with a small internal
    parsed binding action enum that can represent:
    - runtime action callback forwarding for existing split actions;
    - surface close request for `close_surface`.
  - Extend `parse_binding_action` to accept `close_surface` with no parameter.
  - Update `roastty_surface_binding_action` to dispatch parsed close actions via
    `Surface::request_close` and return `true` for attached surfaces.
  - Keep existing split-action parsing and callback return semantics unchanged.

- `roastty/tests/abi_harness.c`
  - Add smoke coverage that `close_surface:now` is rejected and `close_surface`
    can be called through the binding-action ABI.

- Tests in `roastty/src/lib.rs`
  - Cover `close_surface` invoking the runtime close callback with surface
    userdata.
  - Cover confirm-close policy flowing through `close_surface` binding actions.
  - Cover `close_surface` returning true without a close callback on an attached
    surface.
  - Cover null and detached surfaces returning false with no close callback side
    effects.
  - Cover malformed `close_surface:*` returning false.
  - Re-run the existing split binding-action tests to prove their semantics did
    not change.

## Verification

Run:

- `cargo fmt -p roastty`
- `cargo test -p roastty binding_action -- --nocapture`
- `cargo test -p roastty request_close -- --nocapture`
- `cargo test -p roastty --test abi_harness`
- `cargo fmt -p roastty -- --check`
- `git diff --check`

## Design Review

Codex reviewed the staged Experiment 703 design and approved the technical scope
with no implementation blockers. The review confirmed that upstream
`close_surface` is a void binding action, rejects colon parameters, calls
`Surface.close()`, and then returns `true` from `performBindingAction`.

The review also confirmed that Roastty's `Surface::request_close` already has
optional runtime callback behavior, so returning `true` for an attached parsed
`close_surface` action even when no close callback is installed matches the
upstream action-performed semantics. The only initial findings were workflow
items: record this design-review section and update the README provenance tuple
before the plan commit.
