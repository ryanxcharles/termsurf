# Experiment 19: Minimize, Hide, and Restore

## Description

Experiment 18 proved browser overlay geometry and input routing through native
fullscreen and unfullscreen transitions. The next matrix row is minimize, hide,
and restore.

This experiment should prove a browser overlay follows the owning native window
visibility state: hidden/minimized windows should not leave an interactive
browser overlay behind, and restoring the window should bring back the same
browser identity, geometry, hit-testing, and keyboard routing.

This experiment intentionally covers one window with one browser overlay. It
does not test fullscreen, display moves, split panes, multiple windows,
DevTools, or final matrix regression.

If current Ghostboard already passes, the experiment should record that and
avoid product source changes. If it fails, the harness must first localize
whether the failure is minimize action dispatch, app hide/show behavior,
on-screen window detection, AppKit overlay visibility, stale hit testing, or
keyboard routing before any product fix is designed.

## Changes

Planned files:

- `scripts/ghostboard-geometry-matrix.sh`
  - add a `minimize-hide-restore` scenario;
  - add generated Swift helpers, or extend existing helpers, to:
    - minimize and deminimize the target native window through accessibility;
    - hide and unhide/activate the app through public AppKit APIs;
    - read whether the target window is minimized and whether it is visible in
      the CG window list;
  - launch one browser in one Ghostboard window using the repo-built `web` and
    Roamium binaries;
  - record the baseline canonical identity tuple:
    `window_id + surface_id + selected_tab_id + pane_id + browser_tab_id`, plus
    `context_id + AppKit frame + AppKit pixels + backing_scale`;
  - minimize the native window through the public/accessibility path;
  - independently prove the window is minimized or no longer present as an
    onscreen layer-0 CG window;
  - fail if a click at the former browser overlay area produces a fresh hit-test
    routed to the hidden/minimized browser context;
  - restore/deminimize the window through the public/accessibility path;
  - wait for current AppKit presentation/pixel records after restore;
  - require the same canonical browser identity, or if macOS changes the native
    CG window id, record the current window id and prove AppKit/hit-test
    evidence is tied to that current id without accepting stale records;
  - prove restored hit testing uses the restored AppKit frame, surface id,
    selected tab id, context id, and web-relative coordinates;
  - enter Browse mode and prove keyboard input reaches the same browser after
    minimize/restore;
  - return to Control mode;
  - hide the app through a public AppKit path;
  - independently prove the target window is not visible in the onscreen CG
    window list while hidden;
  - fail if a click at the former browser overlay area produces a fresh hit-test
    routed to the hidden browser context;
  - activate/unhide the app through a public AppKit path;
  - wait for current AppKit presentation/pixel records after unhide;
  - re-prove canonical identity, current window id behavior, hit testing, and
    Browse-mode keyboard routing;
  - capture screenshots before minimize, after restore, and after unhide;
  - fail if assertions accept baseline records as restore/unhide proof or accept
    hidden/minimized stale hit-test records.
- `ghostboard/macos/Sources/Ghostty/Surface View/SurfaceView_AppKit.swift`
  - change only if runtime evidence proves minimized/hidden windows leave
    browser overlays visible or hit-testable, or fail to restore overlay
    frame/pixels after being shown.
- `ghostboard/macos/Sources/Features/Terminal/TerminalController.swift`
  - change only if runtime evidence proves native minimize/hide/show transitions
    do not update terminal surface/window visibility state.
- `ghostboard/src/apprt/termsurf.zig`
  - change only if runtime evidence proves TermSurf lifecycle or visibility
    messages are incomplete for minimize/hide/show.
- `roamium/src/dispatch.rs`
  - change only if existing trace evidence cannot prove focus/key input after
    restore/unhide. Any such change must be trace-only under the existing trace
    mechanism.
- `issues/0809-ghostboard-viewport-geometry/19-minimize-hide-restore.md`
  - record the design review, implementation, verification, completion review,
    result, and conclusion.
- `issues/0809-ghostboard-viewport-geometry/README.md`
  - add Experiment 19 to the experiment index.

  prettier --write --prose-wrap always --print-width 80 \
    issues/0809-ghostboard-viewport-geometry/README.md \
    issues/0809-ghostboard-viewport-geometry/19-minimize-hide-restore.md
  ```

- Shell syntax is valid:

  ```bash
  bash -n scripts/ghostboard-geometry-matrix.sh
  ```

- If Zig files are changed:

  ```bash
  cd ghostboard
  zig fmt src/apprt/termsurf.zig
  zig build -Demit-macos-app=false
  ```

- If Swift files are changed:

  ```bash
  cd ghostboard
  macos/build.nu --scheme Ghostty --configuration Debug --action build
  ```

- If Rust files are changed:

  ```bash
  cargo fmt
  cargo check -p roamium
  ```

- The new scenario passes:

  ```bash
  scripts/ghostboard-geometry-matrix.sh minimize-hide-restore
  ```

- The passing run proves:
  - minimize is invoked through a public/accessibility path;
  - the window is independently proven minimized or absent from the onscreen CG
    window list;
  - clicking the former browser area while minimized does not create a fresh
    hit-test for the browser context;
  - after deminimize/restore, the browser proves the expected current-window
    identity behavior and keeps the same surface id, selected tab id, pane id,
    browser tab id, and context id;
  - restored AppKit frame/pixels/backing scale are current, not stale baseline
    records;
  - restored mouse hit-testing and Browse-mode keyboard input route to the
    browser;
  - hide is invoked through a public AppKit path;
  - the window is independently proven absent from the onscreen CG window list
    while hidden;
  - clicking the former browser area while hidden does not create a fresh
    hit-test for the browser context;
  - after unhide/activate, the browser again proves current-window identity,
    geometry, hit-testing, and Browse-mode keyboard routing;
  - screenshots show baseline, restored-after-minimize, and restored-after-hide
    states.
- Adjacent geometry regressions still pass:

  ```bash
  scripts/ghostboard-geometry-matrix.sh fullscreen-unfullscreen
  scripts/ghostboard-geometry-matrix.sh open-browser-in-new-window
  ```

- `git diff --check` passes.
- The design review is recorded in this experiment file and the plan is
  committed before implementation begins.
- After implementation, verification, and result recording, the completion
  review is recorded in this experiment file and the result commit is made
  before designing or implementing Experiment 20.

Fail criteria:

- The harness fakes hide/minimize by changing private TermSurf state instead of
  invoking native/public window or app APIs.
- A minimized or hidden browser remains hit-testable from the former visible
  overlay area.
- Restore/unhide changes surface id, selected tab id, pane id, browser tab id,
  or context id.
- Current window id behavior is ambiguous: post-restore/unhide evidence is not
  tied either to the preserved window id or to an explicitly recorded current
  replacement window id.
- AppKit frame/pixels/backing scale evidence is missing or stale after restore
  or unhide.
- Keyboard input after restore/unhide reaches the wrong browser or no browser.
- The experiment expands into fullscreen, display moves, DevTools, split panes,
  multiple windows, or final matrix regression before minimize/hide/restore
  behavior is isolated.

## Design Review

Fresh-context adversarial review approved the design before implementation.

Verdict: **APPROVED**.

Findings: none.

## Result

**Result:** Pass

Implemented the `minimize-hide-restore` scenario in
`scripts/ghostboard-geometry-matrix.sh`.

The passing target run was:

```bash
scripts/ghostboard-geometry-matrix.sh minimize-hide-restore
```

Evidence:

- Harness log:
  `logs/ghostboard-geometry-minimize-hide-restore-harness-20260617-133208.log`
- App log:
  `logs/ghostboard-geometry-minimize-hide-restore-app-20260617-133208.log`
- Roamium trace:
  `logs/ghostboard-geometry-minimize-hide-restore-roamium-20260617-133208.log`
- Baseline screenshot:
  `logs/ghostboard-geometry-minimize-hide-restore-screenshot-20260617-133208.png`
- Minimize restore screenshot:
  `logs/ghostboard-geometry-minimize-hide-restore-minimize-restored-screenshot-20260617-133208.png`
- Hide restore screenshot:
  `logs/ghostboard-geometry-minimize-hide-restore-hide-restored-screenshot-20260617-133208.png`

The run proved:

- the native window minimized through Accessibility by setting `AXMinimized`;
- the minimized window disappeared from the onscreen layer-0 CG window list;
- a click in the former browser area while minimized did not route a fresh
  hit-test to the browser context;
- deminimize restored the same native window id, surface id, selected tab id,
  pane id, browser tab id, and context id;
- a fresh post-restore AppKit backing-properties record proved the restored
  browser kept the same AppKit frame and backing scale, and the harness computed
  the current AppKit pixel size from that current frame and scale;
- restored mouse hit-testing used the restored AppKit frame and included
  webview-relative coordinates;
- Browse-mode keyboard input after minimize restore reached Roamium;
- app hide succeeded in this VM through the System Events fallback after
  `NSRunningApplication.hide()` returned false;
- the hidden window disappeared from the onscreen layer-0 CG window list;
- a click in the former browser area while hidden did not route a fresh hit-test
  to the browser context;
- unhide/show restored the same native window id, and a fresh post-unhide
  hit-test proved the current AppKit frame and backing scale while the harness
  computed the current AppKit pixel size from that current frame and scale;
- mouse hit-testing and Browse-mode keyboard input worked again after unhide.

Adjacent regression runs also passed:

```bash
scripts/ghostboard-geometry-matrix.sh fullscreen-unfullscreen
scripts/ghostboard-geometry-matrix.sh open-browser-in-new-window
```

Evidence:

- Fullscreen harness log:
  `logs/ghostboard-geometry-fullscreen-unfullscreen-harness-20260617-133244.log`
- Fullscreen app log:
  `logs/ghostboard-geometry-fullscreen-unfullscreen-app-20260617-133244.log`
- Fullscreen Roamium trace:
  `logs/ghostboard-geometry-fullscreen-unfullscreen-roamium-20260617-133244.log`
- New-window harness log:
  `logs/ghostboard-geometry-open-browser-in-new-window-harness-20260617-133310.log`
- New-window app log:
  `logs/ghostboard-geometry-open-browser-in-new-window-app-20260617-133310.log`
- New-window Roamium trace:
  `logs/ghostboard-geometry-open-browser-in-new-window-roamium-20260617-133310.log`

Validation:

```bash
bash -n scripts/ghostboard-geometry-matrix.sh
git diff --check
```

Both checks passed.

## Conclusion

Ghostboard keeps browser overlays correctly non-interactive while the owning
window is minimized or hidden, and restores the same browser identity, geometry,
hit-testing, and keyboard routing when the window becomes visible again.

One automation learning matters for future experiments: in this macOS VM,
`NSRunningApplication.hide()` can return false even after activation. The
harness therefore uses AppKit first and falls back to the public System Events
visibility path for app hide/show automation.

## Completion Review

Fresh-context adversarial completion review initially returned **CHANGES
REQUIRED**.

Required findings:

- The restore and unhide pixel assertions could pass without any fresh AppKit
  pixel evidence because they only checked that no different later
  `presented_pixels` line appeared.
- The hide/show path did not require a fresh AppKit geometry record after unhide
  while the result claimed AppKit frame, pixel size, and backing scale
  stability.

Fixes:

- Added `appkit_pixel_from_geometry_line` to compute current AppKit pixel size
  from a fresh geometry line's overlay frame and backing scale.
- Required the post-minimize-restore backing-properties record to compute the
  expected current AppKit pixel size.
- Required the post-hide-restore hit-test record to compute the expected current
  AppKit pixel size.
- Reran the target scenario and adjacent regressions, then updated the result
  evidence paths and claims.

Fresh-context adversarial re-review approved the completed result.

Verdict: **APPROVED**.

Findings: none.
