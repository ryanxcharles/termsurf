# Issue 805: Roastty Parity with Ghostty 2c62d182

## Goal

Prove that Roastty is functionally equivalent to Ghostty commit
`2c62d182cec246764ff725096a70b9ef44996f7f` for the copied macOS app, the
embedded C ABI surface, and the terminal/runtime behavior reimplemented in
`libroastty`.

The issue is complete only when every relevant Ghostty feature, configuration
option, app workflow, input path, renderer behavior, terminal behavior, and
integration point is either proven passing in Roastty, explicitly marked not
applicable, or accepted as an intentional documented divergence.

## Background

Roastty is a Rust reimplementation of Ghostty's `libghostty` behavior with a
renamed/adapted macOS GUI on top. Issues 800 through 804 established the
architecture, ported the terminal/runtime surface, copied and renamed the macOS
app, finished GUI automation readiness, and proved keyboard and mouse automation
can drive the current app in this VM.

The upstream reference is fixed:

- Ghostty commit: `2c62d182cec246764ff725096a70b9ef44996f7f`
- Branch: `main`
- `git describe`: `tip-1608-g2c62d182c`
- Date recorded in Issue 802: 2026-05-29
- `build.zig.zon`: `version = "1.3.2-dev"`
- Zig version: `0.15.2`

Issue 802 records this exact commit as the vendored Ghostty pin and states that
the copied app and embedded ABI must match it. This issue turns that pin into a
full parity certification gate.

## Scope

Parity means user-visible and integration-visible behavior, not byte-for-byte
implementation identity. Roastty may differ internally when the Rust
implementation produces equivalent behavior.

Required audit domains:

- source-code parity against `vendor/ghostty/`;
- macOS app behavior and workflows;
- embedded C ABI shape and semantics;
- terminal parser/state behavior;
- PTY and process lifecycle behavior;
- renderer/display behavior;
- font discovery, shaping, glyph fallback, and metrics behavior;
- keyboard, mouse, dead-key, IME/preedit, and shortcut handling;
- selection, clipboard, links, menus, tabs, splits, windows, and command palette
  behavior;
- shell integration and terminfo behavior;
- configuration parsing, defaults, formatting, diagnostics, precedence, reload,
  and runtime effects;
- tests, fixtures, and app walkthrough evidence.

Allowed outcomes for each audited item:

- **Pass**: Roastty behavior is proven equivalent with tests, logs, screenshots,
  or another deterministic oracle.
- **Gap**: Roastty behavior diverges and must be fixed before closing this
  issue.
- **Intentional divergence**: Roastty deliberately differs; the difference,
  reason, user impact, and acceptance decision are documented.
- **Not applicable**: The Ghostty behavior does not apply to Roastty, with a
  concrete reason.

## Required Artifacts

This issue should maintain durable parity matrices as experiments progress:

- `feature-matrix.md` — upstream feature/workflow inventory and Roastty status.
- `config-matrix.md` — every relevant Ghostty config option, default, parser,
  formatter, diagnostic, precedence rule, and runtime behavior.
- `source-audit.md` — source subsystem audit findings and fixes.
- `walkthrough-matrix.md` — app walkthrough scenarios, automation commands,
  oracles, and results.
- `divergences.md` — accepted intentional divergences and not-applicable items.

Do not treat the matrices as optional notes. They are the proof surface for
closing the issue.

Each matrix row should record its regression guard:

- guard tier;
- guard command or checklist path;
- when it should run;
- why that tier is sufficient.

Passing behavior without a durable guard remains provisional and does not count
toward final parity certification unless it is explicitly accepted as a manual
walkthrough item.

## Regression Guard Policy

Every passing experiment result should leave behind the cheapest sufficient
guard that would catch a later regression. Do not default to slow GUI tests when
a static check, unit test, or focused integration test proves the behavior.

Guard tiers:

- **Tier 0: Static or matrix check.** Fastest. Use for inventories, ABI symbol
  drift, forbidden-name scans, generated table completeness, config coverage,
  and documentation/matrix consistency.
- **Tier 1: Unit test.** Fast. Use for parsers, config defaults, formatters,
  terminal state transitions, key encoding, selection math, renderer data
  structures, and pure helper behavior.
- **Tier 2: Focused integration test.** Medium. Use for PTY worker behavior,
  config load/reload, shell integration, clipboard helpers, process lifecycle,
  and non-GUI end-to-end paths.
- **Tier 3: GUI smoke test.** Slower. Use when the real macOS app surface is the
  behavior under test, such as launch, keyboard delivery, mouse
  click/drag/scroll, screenshots, menu actions, or accessibility state.
- **Tier 4: Full A/B parity walkthrough.** Slowest. Use for milestone checks,
  nightly/manual certification, or broad Ghostty-versus-Roastty workflow
  comparisons. Do not require this tier for every code change.

Rules:

- Add the cheapest guard that would have caught the regression.
- Slow GUI or full A/B guards require a short justification in the relevant
  matrix row or experiment result.
- Most config behavior should be guarded by static matrix checks and
  parser/default/formatter/runtime unit tests. Only representative runtime
  config behavior should require GUI proof.
- GUI tests should be small, stable, and high-signal. Prefer one representative
  smoke per app/input/rendering surface over exhaustive GUI permutations.
- If a behavior cannot yet be automated, record it as a manual walkthrough row
  with the reason and revisit automation before final certification.

## Proposed Stages

Experiments must still be created one at a time. The stages below define the
intended coverage, not a precommitted experiment list.

### Stage 1: Pin, Scope, and Inventory Schema

Create the parity matrices and define the row schema. Every row should include:

- upstream behavior or source path;
- Roastty implementation path;
- verification method;
- current status;
- evidence artifact;
- owner experiment.

### Stage 2: Source Code Audit

Audit the Roastty implementation against the pinned Ghostty source tree. Look
for bugs, missing behavior, stale assumptions, renamed-app mistakes, and
semantic mismatches. Fix gaps discovered during the audit when they are clearly
in scope for parity.

This stage should cover at least:

- `include/ghostty.h` versus `roastty/include/roastty.h`;
- `src/App.zig`, `src/Surface.zig`, and `src/apprt/embedded.zig` behavior;
- terminal, termio, renderer, font, input, config, shell-integration, and
  macOS-facing bridge behavior;
- Swift app code copied from `vendor/ghostty/macos/Sources`.

### Stage 3: Configuration Parity

Inventory every relevant option in Ghostty's pinned `Config.zig` and related
config helper files. For each option, prove or fix:

- default value;
- parser behavior;
- formatter behavior and order where relevant;
- validation/finalization behavior;
- file, CLI, environment, and runtime precedence;
- diagnostics for invalid values;
- runtime effect in the app when applicable.

Config options that are platform-specific, GTK-only, Linux-only, or otherwise
not applicable to Roastty must still be listed with a reason.

### Stage 4: Upstream Tests and Fixture Port

Identify Ghostty tests, fixtures, generated tables, and behavior examples that
apply to Roastty. Port them directly where practical. Where direct porting is
not practical, create equivalent Roastty tests or document why the upstream test
does not apply.

### Stage 5: App Walkthrough

Build both the pinned Ghostty app and current Roastty app. Walk through the real
macOS app behavior and prove workflows with automation whenever possible.

The walkthrough must cover at least:

- launch, quit, reopen, and cleanup;
- new window, tab, split, focus movement, resize, zoom, and fullscreen;
- text entry, shortcuts, dead keys, IME/preedit, and keybindings;
- mouse click, drag selection, scrollback, shift-click/drag where applicable,
  and mouse reporting;
- copy, paste, clipboard formats, bracketed paste, and selection behavior;
- links, URL opening, hover/cursor behavior, and context menus;
- menus, command palette, titlebar, quick terminal, notifications, bell, and app
  lifecycle behavior;
- font/theme changes, renderer options, window padding, opacity, cursor style,
  and other visible config-driven behavior;
- shell integration, terminfo, title reporting, working directory reporting, and
  process lifecycle.

### Stage 6: A/B Behavioral Matrix

For workflows where visual or terminal behavior matters, run Ghostty and Roastty
with the same recipe and compare deterministic artifacts:

- terminal output;
- screenshots or cropped screenshots;
- pasteboard contents;
- accessibility state;
- process/window state;
- config output;
- logs or trace files.

### Stage 7: Divergence Review

Record every accepted difference in `divergences.md`. Each entry must include:

- upstream Ghostty behavior;
- Roastty behavior;
- why the divergence exists;
- user-visible impact;
- explicit acceptance rationale.

Unaccepted divergences remain gaps and block closure.

### Stage 8: Final Parity Certification

The issue can close only when:

- every matrix row is `Pass`, `Intentional divergence`, or `Not applicable`;
- there are zero unresolved `Gap` rows;
- required automated tests pass;
- the app walkthrough passes;
- source-code audit findings are fixed or accepted as divergences;
- config parity is complete;
- the conclusion names the exact Ghostty commit hash and summarizes the final
  evidence.

## Learnings

Record concrete, reusable findings here as experiments discover how to prove or
fix Roastty parity with Ghostty. Update this section whenever an experiment
learns something that may be useful to future experiments. Keep hypotheses in
experiment files until they are proven.

- **The upstream parity target is fixed.** All source, config, ABI, and app
  behavior comparisons in this issue target Ghostty commit
  `2c62d182cec246764ff725096a70b9ef44996f7f`.
- **Use the resolved Ghostty app build wrapper.** The pinned Ghostty app should
  be built with `scripts/ghostty-app/build-macos-app.sh Debug`, not by
  hand-running `build.zig` from `vendor/ghostty/macos`.
- **Use the current Roastty app bundle.** `scripts/roastty-app/start-app.sh` now
  honors `ROASTTY_APP` and otherwise prefers the newer debug app bundle when
  both Roastty debug layouts exist.
- **The VM can synthesize keyboard and mouse input.** Issue 804 proved System
  Events keyboard input, CGEvent mouse click/drag/scroll, full-window
  screenshots, and cleanup against the current Roastty app after the required
  permissions were granted to Ghostty, the responsible host app for this Codex
  session.
- **Passing behavior needs a durable but cheap guard.** Future experiments
  should record the cheapest sufficient regression guard for each passing parity
  row. Prefer static checks and unit tests when they prove the behavior; reserve
  GUI and full A/B tests for behavior that genuinely requires the real app
  surface.
- **Plain `zig` builds pinned Ghostty on this VM.** Homebrew `zig@0.15` is on
  `PATH` as `/opt/homebrew/bin/zig`, version `0.15.2`. With that toolchain,
  pinned Ghostty builds from a clean source checkout with
  `zig build -Demit-macos-app=false` and
  `nu macos/build.nu --configuration Debug`; the old build-only
  `macos-only-xcframework.patch` is no longer needed for the baseline.
- **Device attributes can be config-derived terminal state.** Pinned Ghostty's
  primary device-attributes reply advertises feature `52` only when
  `clipboard-write != deny`. Roastty now treats that as terminal runtime state:
  deny suppresses `52`, while ask and allow advertise it. This is distinct from
  app-level clipboard read/write policy tests.
- **Default cursor config is live terminal state.** Pinned Ghostty reloads
  `cursor-style` and `cursor-style-blink` into the active stream handler, but
  applies the visible cursor immediately only while the cursor is still in the
  default DECSCUSR state. Roastty now mirrors that: explicit program cursor
  choices survive reload until a default cursor reset is received.
- **Kitty image storage quota is PTY-backed terminal config.** Pinned Ghostty
  applies `image-storage-limit` at terminal startup and live config update, and
  live updates restore kitty image loading limits to all media. Roastty now
  threads the parsed quota through `TermioSpawnOptions` and active surface
  config updates.
- **The pinned A/B build/render rig works.** Experiment 1 proved the debug
  Ghostty and Roastty apps can both build, launch side by side, render the same
  startup recipe through the live A/B smoke harness, capture comparable
  screenshots, and clean up their debug process trees in this VM.
- **Keyboard injection must avoid duplicate Ghostty process targeting.** When
  Codex itself is running inside installed Ghostty, System Events can resolve a
  debug Ghostty PID activation attempt to the installed `ghostty` host process.
  This can send typed test commands into the Codex window instead of the debug
  Ghostty window. Future keyboard experiments must use a safer targeting method
  or a harness that avoids the duplicate-process-name collision.
- **PID-guarded System Events keyboard input works for both debug apps.**
  Experiment 2 proved the safe sequence: activate by exact Unix PID, immediately
  verify the global frontmost PID equals the target PID, and only then type. For
  Roastty, click the terminal window center after activation to give the
  terminal view first-responder focus before the final pre-type PID guard.
- **Parity rows need evidence and guard fields.** Experiment 3 created the
  required feature, config, source-audit, walkthrough, and divergence matrices.
  Every row must name status, verification, evidence, regression guard tier,
  guard command or checklist, cadence, guard sufficiency, and owner experiment;
  divergence rows are not exempt.
- **A/B app runs should use matched config files.** Ghostty loads user config
  from `~/.config/ghostty/config`. Roastty's analogous config path is
  `~/.config/roastty/config`. The user's Ghostty config has been cloned to the
  Roastty path so early A/B runs compare the same visual and behavioral config
  wherever possible. Until a later experiment intentionally tests custom
  Roastty-only config options, keep these files aligned so Ghostty and Roastty
  should look nearly identical except for app naming.
- **Runtime parity for config options must exercise parsed config.** Existing C
  surface configuration tests can prove embedded ABI launch behavior, but they
  do not prove user config options such as `command` and `input` unless the test
  drives parsed app config or config loading. Future CFG-223 experiments should
  keep parsed-config runtime effects separate from direct surface-config
  behavior.
- **Process lifecycle parity needs branch-specific oracles.** Ghostty handles
  abnormal child exit before normal `wait-after-command` close/hold behavior,
  and uses a `<=` runtime threshold. Future process lifecycle experiments must
  either prove the abnormal-exit branch directly or run commands beyond the
  configured threshold when proving the normal child-exit branch.
- **Child-exit parity has separable layers.** Roastty now proves the PTY
  child-exit exit-code/runtime payload reaches the app as `show_child_exited`,
  but terminal fallback text, abnormal-exit close/hold policy after
  handled/unhandled actions, and app quit policy remain separate lifecycle gaps.
- **Child-exit fallback policy is branch-specific.** Abnormal exits use
  `runtime_ms <= abnormal-command-exit-runtime`, try the app action first, and
  hold after GUI or terminal fallback handling; normal exits can write fallback
  text when unhandled but still follow `wait-after-command` close/hold policy.
- **macOS quit-after-last-window parity is a config bridge.** Pinned Ghostty's
  macOS app returns `derivedConfig.shouldQuitAfterLastWindowClosed` from
  `applicationShouldTerminateAfterLastWindowClosed`, while
  `quit-after-last-window-closed-delay` is documented and implemented upstream
  as Linux/GTK-only. Keep broad macOS app/window/menu lifecycle walkthrough work
  separate from this narrow quit-after-last-window bridge.
- **`title-report` is a gated runtime disclosure.** Pinned Ghostty defaults
  `title-report` to `false` and drops CSI `21t` report-title requests at the
  surface config layer unless enabled. Roastty must keep OSC-driven title
  reports off by default and refresh the gate when config updates, while
  configured/static surface-title reporting remains a separate UI/runtime gap.
- **Surface titles must avoid terminal callbacks in worker PTYs.** Roastty's
  Termio worker rejects terminals with callbacks installed, so non-empty OSC/PTY
  title changes should travel through `TermioPump`. Configured static titles and
  direct command argv[0] startup titles are now proven separately from
  empty-title/PWD fallback semantics, which remain a CFG-223 gap.
- **Empty title reset is an event, not just a string diff.** Pinned Ghostty
  sends title messages for empty-title resets even when the effective title is
  blank or unchanged. Roastty now drains explicit pending title events through
  `TermioPump`; OSC 7 PWD normalization and exact nonzero scrollback byte-quota
  wiring are proven separately from other remaining terminal gaps.
- **OSC 7 PWD reports are paths, not raw URLs.** Pinned Ghostty accepts local
  `file` and `kitty-shell-cwd` OSC 7 URLs, requires a local hostname, stores the
  normalized path, dispatches that path as `pwd`, and uses that path for title
  fallback. Roastty now mirrors this common local path behavior through terminal
  state, `TermioPump`, and `ROASTTY_ACTION_PWD`; exact URI edge semantics are
  tracked and guarded separately.
- **OSC 7 `file` and `kitty-shell-cwd` paths intentionally differ.** Pinned
  Ghostty trims query/fragment suffixes and percent-decodes `file` paths, but
  enables raw-path parsing for `kitty-shell-cwd`, preserving percent escapes and
  query/fragment suffixes inside the path. Roastty now guards those edge
  semantics through terminal-core, `TermioPump`, and `ROASTTY_ACTION_PWD` tests.
- **`scrollback-limit` runtime parity has two tiers.** `scrollback-limit = 0`
  disables PTY-backed surface history, while nonzero parsed values must travel
  as byte quotas into terminal storage. Roastty now preserves nonzero parsed
  values through app startup, `TermioSpawnOptions`, `Terminal`, `Screen`, and
  `PageList`; a tiny byte quota keeps less history than a large byte quota for
  the same workload, with PageList pruning guarded by byte-size page growth.
- **Shell startup rewrites can be proven without live shells.** Pinned Ghostty's
  `termio/shell_integration.zig` helper tests define a cheap oracle for shell
  detection, forced-shell setup, bash option/env rewrites, XDG directory setup,
  nushell `--execute` injection/fallback, zsh `ZDOTDIR`, and missing-resource
  fallback. Roastty now mirrors that helper surface with `ROASTTY_*` names while
  leaving script-body and live-shell PTY parity as separate concerns if needed.
- **Font-grid parity has an initial-construction slice and an update slice.**
  Roastty now proves parsed font family/style/codepoint-map/synthetic-style
  config reaches config-derived shared font grid construction and initial live
  renderer setup. Renderer-visible font output, feature/variation/thicken/metric
  effects, and live renderer grid rebuild/update after reload/manual font-size
  changes remain in the reduced font gap.
- **App-facing ABI parity must be scoped before diffing.** Roastty's C header is
  intentionally larger than Ghostty's header, so full symbol-count equality is
  the wrong oracle. Experiment 4 uses Swift app-source identifiers as the
  app-facing ABI slice, then separately records non-app header differences as
  follow-up source-audit rows.
- **Direct keyword enum formatters are a cheap CFG-218 slice.** Experiment 71
  proved that simple enum `format_entry` rows can be promoted by covering every
  upstream tag keyword, raw-empty reset behavior, and representative
  `format_config` ordering while leaving unrelated custom formatters
  audit-covered.
- **Shared enum options can still need scoped formatter proof.** Experiment 72
  promoted `clipboard-read` and `clipboard-write` together because both use
  Ghostty's `ClipboardAccess` enum, but the proof still checked each option's
  distinct default and exact row ownership so unrelated enum-like formatters did
  not advance by accident.
- **Direct color formatter rows are separate from optional color rows.**
  Experiment 73 proved `background`, `foreground`, and the four search color
  rows through `Color`/`TerminalColor` `format_config` output while keeping
  palette, cursor/selection colors, window titlebar colors, and other optional
  color rows outside the promotion.
- **Click-action enum rows should be proven as their own family.** Experiment 74
  promoted `copy-on-select`, `right-click-action`, and `middle-click-action`
  together because they share mouse/click enum formatting, while preserving the
  separate status of window, platform, quick-terminal, and packed/list formatter
  rows.
- **Window enum rows need a narrower family than all window formatters.**
  Experiment 75 promoted only `window-theme`, `window-save-state`,
  `window-new-tab-position`, and `window-show-tab-bar` by proving every enum
  keyword, default/non-default formatted output, raw-empty resets, and local
  order, while leaving `window-decoration`, padding, titlebar colors,
  resize-overlay, and platform-specific window rows for later proof.
- **Resize overlay formatter proof can include its duration row without
  generalizing all durations.** Experiment 76 promoted `resize-overlay`,
  `resize-overlay-position`, and `resize-overlay-duration` together because they
  are one adjacent UI cluster, while keeping unrelated duration rows such as
  `notify-on-command-finish-after` and `undo-timeout` outside the promotion.
- **Quick-terminal enum formatter rows are separable from quick-terminal
  scalars.** Experiment 77 promoted the five simple quick-terminal enum rows
  while using order checks around `quick-terminal-size`,
  `gtk-quick-terminal-namespace`, `quick-terminal-animation-duration`, and
  `quick-terminal-autohide` to keep those custom formatter rows unpromoted until
  they have their own proof.
- **Command-finish notification rows can be proven as one adjacent cluster.**
  Experiment 78 promoted `notify-on-command-finish`,
  `notify-on-command-finish-action`, and `notify-on-command-finish-after`
  together by covering enum keywords, packed flag output, duration output,
  resets, and order while leaving unrelated packed flags and duration rows for
  later proof.
- **Packed-flag formatter rows need family-column assertions, not broad text
  grep.** Experiment 79 promoted the six remaining packed-flag formatter rows
  while keeping already-proven packed rows unpromoted. The matrix assertion must
  inspect the family column because unrelated evidence text may legitimately
  mention packed flag output.
- **Background-image enum rows are distinct from adjacent image scalars.**
  Experiment 80 promoted only `background-image-fit` and
  `background-image-position` by proving every enum keyword, representative
  `Config::set` plus `format_config` output, raw-empty resets, and local order
  while keeping `background-image`, `background-image-opacity`, and
  `background-image-repeat` outside the family.
- **GTK enum formatter rows should include compatibility inputs without
  expanding the family.** Experiment 81 promoted `gtk-single-instance`,
  `gtk-tabs-location`, `gtk-toolbar-style`, and `gtk-titlebar-style` by proving
  enum keyword output, config-level output, raw-empty resets, and compatibility
  shims such as `desktop`, `hidden`, and `adw-toolbar-style`, while leaving GTK
  booleans and `gtk-custom-css` out of the promoted family.
- **macOS enum formatter rows are broad but still bounded.** Experiment 82
  promoted the nine remaining macOS direct enum formatter rows together because
  they share adjacent macOS formatter dispatch and keyword semantics, while
  proving the `macos-dock-drop-behavior = window` compatibility shim and keeping
  adjacent optional/scalar rows such as `macos-option-as-alt`,
  `macos-custom-icon`, and icon color rows outside the family.
- **Misc direct enum formatter rows can be closed before custom rows.**
  Experiment 83 promoted `async-backend`, `confirm-close-surface`,
  `custom-shader-animation`, `fullscreen`, `grapheme-width-method`,
  `link-previews`, `linux-cgroup`, `shell-integration`, and `window-subtitle` by
  proving direct keyword output, config-level output, raw-empty resets, and
  local ordering, leaving the truly custom scalar/collection rows for later.
- **The final formatter close condition is all rows Oracle complete.**
  Experiment 84 promoted the last nine `custom format_entry` rows, moved CFG-218
  to `Pass`, and changed the generated complete note to include the owner and
  row counts. Formatter parity now has 203 `Oracle complete` rows, 0
  audit-covered rows, and 0 gaps.
- **Diagnostic parity needs its own inventory.** Experiment 85 found 122
  canonical options with explicit diagnostic evidence already in parser-family
  or option-specific oracles and 81 options that still need explicit
  `ConfigDiagnostic` proof. CFG-219 now has a concrete row inventory and remains
  `Gap` until every diagnostic row is `Oracle complete`.
- **Boolean diagnostic rows can be promoted by an exact row table.** Experiment
  86 promoted the 39 direct boolean diagnostic rows by iterating every
  incomplete boolean option, checking exact true/false tokens, empty reset, bare
  true, file and CLI diagnostics, and invalid-value state retention. CFG-219 now
  has 161 `Oracle complete` rows and 42 remaining incomplete diagnostic rows.
- **Integer diagnostics share missing-value behavior across required and
  optional fields.** Experiment 87 promoted the ten integer scalar diagnostic
  rows and confirmed that empty values reset optional integer fields, while bare
  missing values report `ConfigSetError::ValueRequired` for both required and
  optional integer fields. CFG-219 now has 171 `Oracle complete` rows and 32
  remaining incomplete diagnostic rows.
- **Float diagnostics can reuse formatted-state assertions.** Experiment 88
  promoted the nine float scalar diagnostic rows with finite non-default values,
  empty reset checks, missing-value diagnostics, file and CLI invalid-value
  diagnostics, and state-retention checks through `format_config` output.
  CFG-219 now has 180 `Oracle complete` rows and 23 remaining incomplete
  diagnostic rows.
- **String diagnostics are missing-value diagnostics.** Experiment 89 promoted
  the nine string diagnostic rows and corrected the diagnostic inventory family
  from invalid-value wording to required-value wording. Explicit string values,
  including NUL-containing strings, are accepted; missing values report
  `ConfigSetError::ValueRequired` and preserve prior state. CFG-219 now has 189
  `Oracle complete` rows and 14 remaining incomplete diagnostic rows.
- **Duration zero values need internal-state checks.** Experiment 90 promoted
  the four duration diagnostic rows and confirmed that invalid duration values
  report `ConfigSetError::InvalidValue`, missing values report
  `ConfigSetError::ValueRequired`, and both preserve prior state. Duration zero
  formats as an empty value, so tests must also assert internal zero state to
  distinguish zero from empty-reset semantics. CFG-219 now has 193
  `Oracle complete` rows and 10 remaining incomplete diagnostic rows.
- **Working-directory diagnostics are source-specific required-value checks.**
  Experiment 91 promoted the `working-directory` diagnostic row and confirmed
  that bare config-file keys plus missing/all-whitespace CLI values report
  `ConfigSetError::ValueRequired` while preserving prior state. Config-file
  whitespace after `=` is normalized as an empty reset, not a diagnostic.
  CFG-219 now has 194 `Oracle complete` rows and 9 remaining incomplete
  diagnostic rows.
- **Path diagnostics are missing-value diagnostics, with CLI base expansion.**
  Experiment 92 promoted the three path diagnostic rows and confirmed that
  explicit required, optional, quoted, and NUL-containing path values are
  accepted, raw empty values reset, parsed-empty values are no-ops, and missing
  config-file/CLI values report `ConfigSetError::ValueRequired` while preserving
  state. CLI parsing can expand existing relative path state, so diagnostic
  state-retention tests should use absolute setup paths. CFG-219 now has 197
  `Oracle complete` rows and 6 remaining incomplete diagnostic rows.
- **Command-palette diagnostics are structured invalid-value checks.**
  Experiment 93 promoted `command-palette-entry` and confirmed that malformed
  structured entries report `ConfigSetError::InvalidValue`, config-file
  diagnostics preserve line/key/error while later valid entries still load, and
  CLI diagnostics preserve argument position/key/error while retaining prior and
  later valid entries. Empty and missing direct values restore defaults. CFG-219
  now has 198 `Oracle complete` rows and 5 remaining incomplete diagnostic rows.
- **Font RepeatableString diagnostics are missing-value diagnostics.**
  Experiment 94 promoted `font-family`, `font-family-bold`,
  `font-family-italic`, `font-family-bold-italic`, and `font-feature`, and
  confirmed that explicit values, including NUL-containing values, append and
  format while raw empty values reset. Missing direct, config-file, and CLI
  values report `ConfigSetError::ValueRequired` while preserving prior state.
  CFG-219 now has 203 `Oracle complete` rows and 0 remaining incomplete
  diagnostic rows.
- **Finalization parity needs row-level runtime-context proof.** Experiment 95
  split CFG-220 into 17 pinned Ghostty `Config.finalize` behaviors. Existing
  Roastty tests prove 14 rows, while click-repeat interval app OS defaulting,
  unfocused split opacity clamping, and auto-update-channel release-channel
  defaulting remain audit-covered follow-ups. CFG-220 remains `Gap` with 14
  `Oracle complete` rows, 3 incomplete rows, and 0 structural finalization gaps.
- **Unfocused split opacity finalization is already proven by the split visual
  oracle.** Experiment 96 promoted FINAL-010 by citing
  `split_visual_config_defaults_parse_format_and_finalize`, which proves default
  formatting plus below-minimum, above-maximum, and config-file parsed
  out-of-range clamps. CFG-220 remains `Gap` with 15 `Oracle complete` rows, 2
  incomplete rows, and 0 structural finalization gaps.
- **Pinned Ghostty's auto-update channel finalizes to `tip`.** Experiment 97
  promoted FINAL-015 by proving the pinned Ghostty `1.3.2-dev` prerelease build
  derives `build_config.release_channel = tip`, and Roastty's
  `config_finalize_scalar_tail` proves unset `auto-update-channel` finalizes to
  `Tip` while explicit values are preserved. CFG-220 remains `Gap` with 16
  `Oracle complete` rows, 1 incomplete row, and 0 structural finalization gaps.
- **Click-repeat interval finalization uses the platform OS helper.** Experiment
  98 updated Roastty to match pinned Ghostty's
  `internal_os.clickInterval() orelse 500` behavior by routing finalization
  through `mouse::click_interval().unwrap_or(500)`, with deterministic test
  coverage for OS-provided values, fallback 500, nonzero preservation, and the
  parser/finalize boundary. CFG-220 now has 17 `Oracle complete` rows and 0
  incomplete finalization rows, so validation/finalization parity is `Pass`.
- **CFG-221 now has an explicit load/precedence manifest.** Experiment 99 split
  source precedence into 18 pinned Ghostty load rows. Existing Roastty tests
  prove 15 rows; full end-to-end load pipeline order remains audit-covered, and
  default template creation plus recursive replay placement before the initial
  command suffix are structural gaps. CFG-221 remains `Gap` with 15
  `Oracle complete` rows, 3 incomplete rows, and 2 load gaps.
- **Default config template creation includes content parity.** Experiment 100
  promoted `LOAD-008` by creating the missing default config template at the
  same selected target as pinned Ghostty and proving the generated file matches
  the pinned template text after substituting the selected path. CFG-221 now has
  16 `Oracle complete` rows, 2 incomplete rows, and 1 load gap.
- **Recursive config-file replay must stay before the initial-command suffix.**
  Experiment 101 added an internal replay boundary matching pinned Ghostty's
  `-e` marker behavior. Recursive `config-file` replay entries are now inserted
  before that boundary, keep file/config-entry representation, and replay as
  config while the original initial-command suffix remains unchanged. CFG-221
  now has 17 `Oracle complete` rows, 1 incomplete row, and 0 load gaps.
- **Config load precedence now has full pipeline proof.** Experiment 102 added a
  focused pipeline oracle proving Roastty starts from defaults, then applies
  default files, CLI args, recursive config files, and finalization in pinned
  Ghostty order. All 18 CFG-221 load rows are now `Oracle complete`, so config
  source precedence and repeated-file load semantics are `Pass`.
- **CFG-222 reload parity now has an explicit manifest.** Experiment 103 split
  config reload behavior into 14 pinned Ghostty reload rows. Existing Roastty
  tests and source evidence prove 12 rows, while surface reload still needs to
  clear active key tables and apply configured font-size changes without
  overriding manually adjusted font sizes.
- **Surface config reload must clear active key tables.** Experiment 104 matched
  pinned Ghostty's `Surface.updateConfig` behavior by clearing
  `active_key_tables` during Roastty surface config update and emitting the
  existing deactivate-all notification when a stack was active. CFG-222 now has
  one remaining reload gap: configured font-size reload behavior with manual
  adjustment preservation.
- **Config reload parity is now complete.** Experiment 105 matched pinned
  Ghostty's reload font-size rule: unadjusted surfaces adopt the reloaded
  configured font size, manual font-size adjustments are preserved across
  reload, and reset-font-size targets the newly reloaded configured font size.
  All 14 CFG-222 reload rows are now `Oracle complete`, so config reload
  behavior is `Pass`.
- **CFG-223 now has a runtime/UI effect manifest.** Experiment 106 split broad
  runtime and UI config effects into 14 rows. Existing Roastty tests and
  divergence records close 6 rows, while mouse/click/cursor behavior, broad font
  runtime behavior, renderer-visible effects, terminal toggles beyond VT KAM,
  PTY/process launch effects beyond initial command and inherited working
  directory, macOS app/window/menu workflows, notifications/bell/link behavior,
  and platform-specific classifications remain gaps.
- **Mouse runtime coverage must stay split by behavior.** Experiment 107 split
  the broad `RUNTIME-004` row into eight mouse subrows. Mouse reporting/toggle,
  mouse shift capture, scroll multiplier, and click-repeat timing are now
  `Oracle complete`; `cursor-click-to-move`, `mouse-hide-while-typing`,
  `right-click-action`, and `middle-click-action` remain explicit runtime/UI
  gaps.
- **OSC 133 prompt-click options belong to prompt-start commands.** Experiment
  108 found that `OSC 133;B` starts input but must not clear the prompt-click
  mode from `OSC 133;A;click_events=1` or `OSC 133;A;cl=line`. Roastty now
  persists prompt-click mode across input/output semantic markers and guards
  `cursor-click-to-move` with pty-backed surface mouse tests.
- **Middle-click paste follows copy-on-select, but not mouse reporting.**
  Experiment 109 matched pinned Ghostty's `middle-click-action` behavior:
  `primary-paste` reads the selection clipboard for `copy-on-select = true` or
  `false`, falls back to standard when selection clipboards are unsupported,
  reads standard for `copy-on-select = clipboard`, and does not bypass terminal
  mouse reporting.
- **Right-click actions run only after mouse reporting declines the event.**
  Experiment 110 matched pinned Ghostty's `right-click-action` behavior for
  `ignore`, `paste`, `copy`, `copy-or-paste`, and non-link `context-menu`.
  Reporting-mode right clicks clear selection, reset selection gesture state,
  dispatch the mouse report, and skip right-click action side effects; link
  context-menu behavior remains tracked under notification/link runtime parity.
- **Mouse hiding belongs after fallthrough keybindings and before encoding.**
  Experiment 111 matched pinned Ghostty's `mouse-hide-while-typing` behavior:
  text key presses hide the mouse once, releases and empty-text keys do not
  hide, unconsumed configured bindings still hide before encoded fallthrough
  input, mouse movement/button/scroll show the mouse again, and disabling the
  option by config update shows an already-hidden mouse.
- **Platform-specific runtime effects need classification, not blanket
  closure.** Experiment 112 generated a platform runtime manifest for every
  `gtk-*`, `linux-*`, and `macos-*` canonical option. GTK/Linux rows are not
  applicable to Roastty's macOS runtime, `macos-option-as-alt` is covered by
  input guards, and remaining macOS app behavior stays owned by `RUNTIME-011`.
- **Broad runtime rows should split proven slices from real gaps.** Experiment
  113 split PTY/process launch coverage so initial-command, environment, and
  working-directory behavior are guarded separately while config-level command,
  startup input, wait/abnormal-exit, and quit policy remain explicit gaps.
- **Terminal runtime toggles should not hide under broad terminal gaps.**
  Experiment 114 split `vt-kam-allowed` into its own guarded runtime row while
  scrollback, alternate screen, shell integration, terminfo, title reporting,
  and remaining terminal behavior stay explicit gaps.
- **Deterministic link/open-url behavior can be guarded separately from GUI link
  UX.** Experiment 115 split URL link finalization, renderer link ranges,
  explicit open-url dispatch, and OSC8 copy-url bindings from the bell,
  notification, hover, preview, and context/menu gaps.
- **Live BEL dispatch must avoid terminal callbacks.** Experiment 123 found that
  Roastty's embedded C bell callback path is intentionally unavailable to
  `TermioWorker` terminals because workers reject callback-installed terminals.
  Live PTY-backed BEL parity therefore flows through terminal pending bell
  counts, `TermioPump::bell_count`, and surface `ROASTTY_ACTION_RING_BELL`
  dispatch with a 100ms repeated-BEL throttle.
- **Copied macOS bell presentation has source-level gates.** Experiment 153
  proved the copied macOS host preserves pinned Ghostty's aggregate window bell
  publisher, close-time bell clear, dock badge count, surface border overlay,
  title bell prefix, and separate `bell-features = system`, `audio`,
  `attention`, `title`, and `border` gates after expected Roastty renames.
  Actual OS/audio/dock/border/title side effects still need GUI or platform
  walkthrough proof in `RUNTIME-012B2B2B2`.
- **OSC desktop notifications need a PTY event queue.** Experiment 141 found
  that Roastty already parsed OSC 9 and OSC 777 desktop notification commands,
  but the live terminal path dropped them. PTY-backed parity now queues terminal
  desktop notification events through `TermioPump`, applies the
  `desktop-notifications` gate at the surface, and dispatches the app action
  with Ghostty's fixed 63-byte title and 255-byte body C-string truncation.
- **macOS user-notification plumbing is copied source parity.** Experiment 155
  proved the copied macOS host preserves pinned Ghostty's notification category
  registration, foreground presentation gate, authorization/settings gate,
  surface notification content/request lifecycle, identifier cleanup, delayed
  focused cleanup, and click-to-focus routing after expected Roastty renames.
  Command-finish notifications, app-notifications, live OS banner/sound
  delivery, actual bell side effects, and link UI flows remain in
  `RUNTIME-012B2B2B2`.
- **Desktop notification throttling is app-level runtime state.** Experiment 156
  split Ghostty's one-second desktop-notification throttle and five-second
  identical-notification suppression out of the remaining notification gap.
  Roastty now stores app-level limiter state, compares the delimiterless
  truncated `title || body` byte stream that Ghostty feeds to Wyhash, suppresses
  without updating state, and shares the limiter across surfaces on the same
  app.
- **The terminal residual gap was an audit problem, not a hidden runtime
  toggle.** Experiment 142 exhaustively mapped pinned Ghostty `DerivedConfig`,
  direct termio config uses, and stream-handler config updates to existing
  completed rows. The remaining CFG-223 gaps are now explicitly non-terminal:
  font renderer output, renderer-visible GUI/pixel effects, macOS app UI, and
  native notification/link/bell presentation flows.
- **ENQ responses must avoid terminal callbacks in worker PTYs.** Experiment 135
  found the same worker constraint applies to `enquiry-response`: embedded
  callback ENQ handling can remain for direct terminal users, but live
  PTY-backed parity needs owned terminal response state populated from parsed
  config, passed through `TermioSpawnOptions`, and updated on app config reload.
- **OSC color report format is terminal response state.** Experiment 136 found
  that `osc-color-report-format` belongs on the live terminal, not only in the
  parser: OSC 4/10/11/12 query replies must use the configured `none`, `8-bit`,
  or `16-bit` response format at startup and after app config updates, while
  set/reset color operations still run when query replies are disabled.
- **Grapheme width method is a terminal default mode.** Experiment 140 found
  that pinned Ghostty maps `grapheme-width-method` into DEC 2027
  `grapheme_cluster` during `Termio.init`, storing it as both current and reset
  default mode state. Roastty parity therefore requires startup wiring plus
  direct reset/RIS proof, not just setting the current mode bit.
- **Manual font-size changes must rebuild live font grids.** Experiment 143
  found that requesting render after changing `font_size_points` is not enough
  for a live Metal renderer: the existing renderer can keep its old
  config-derived `SharedGrid`. Roastty now invalidates the live renderer on
  effective font-size changes so the next present rebuilds the grid at the
  active surface size.
- **Shell integration parity has a proven Termio env slice.** Experiment 124
  split terminal identity, resource-backed `TERMINFO`, explicit env override
  ordering, shell feature env, and zsh bootstrap behavior out of the broader
  terminal runtime gap. Those behaviors are guarded by child-visible Termio
  runtime tests plus a static Ghostty/Roastty marker check; exact nonzero
  scrollback byte quota and configured/static surface-title reporting remain
  separate terminal gaps.
- **Renderer control parity is separate from visible renderer parity.**
  Experiment 125 split `window-vsync` present scheduling, cursor blink
  timing/reset behavior, focus/occlusion control, and live renderer rebuild
  requests from the broader renderer gap. Visible opacity, blur, padding, cursor
  shape/style rendering, window padding color, custom shader output, and GUI
  visual effects still need focused runtime or walkthrough proof.
- **Deterministic renderer knobs can close before GUI pixel parity.** Experiment
  133 split config-to-renderer-state and renderer-decision behavior from the
  remaining visual renderer gap. `FrameRenderKnobs::from_config` now clamps
  `background-opacity` at renderer use like pinned Ghostty, and unit/static
  guards prove opacity conversion, `background-opacity-cells`,
  `window-padding-color` padding-extension decisions, and `font-thicken` knob
  sourcing. macOS glass host behavior, non-glass compositor opacity, window
  padding layout pixels, cursor style shape/rendering pixels, custom shader
  output, and broader GUI/pixel parity remain in the renderer visual gap.
- **Selected cursor render data is not the same as full cursor priority or GUI
  pixels.** Experiment 134 split deterministic active cursor overlay/uniform
  branches, cursor color/text-color resolution, selected cursor sprite/glyph
  data, wide cursor data, lock fallback rendering after lock selection, and
  cursor list routing out of the renderer visual gap. Password/preedit cursor
  style priority through the active renderer path and actual GUI cursor pixels
  remain in `RUNTIME-008B2B`.
- **Cursor priority belongs on the active frame path, not only in the isolated
  helper.** Experiment 144 routed active frame cursor derivation through the
  shared Ghostty-port cursor priority helper and derives preedit priority from
  the real render method's `preedit` argument. Password/preedit priority is now
  split out as `RUNTIME-008B2B1`; GUI cursor pixels, macOS glass/non-glass
  compositor visuals, padding pixels, custom shader output, and broader GUI/
  pixel parity remain in `RUNTIME-008B2B2`.
- **Font shaping break is renderer row-format state.** Experiment 145 split
  `font-shaping-break` cursor-run break behavior out of the remaining font
  renderer gap. Roastty now applies `FontShapingBreak` to row-local `RunOptions`
  in active frame row formatting, matching pinned Ghostty's renderer-side
  application after viewport cursor derivation. Remaining font work stays in
  `RUNTIME-007B2B2B2B`.
- **Font thickening has a deterministic non-`sbix` render slice.** Experiment
  146 split `font-thicken` and `font-thicken-strength` option propagation,
  shared glyph-cache key separation, and CoreText non-`sbix` canvas
  padding/strength behavior out of the remaining font renderer gap. Bitmap/color
  font thickening edge cases, feature effects, fallback visual output, glyph
  metrics, and broad font pixel parity remain in `RUNTIME-007B2B2B2B`.
- **Font features are active renderer shaping options.** Experiment 147 split
  deterministic `font-feature` propagation out of the remaining font renderer
  gap by threading config-derived shape options into active row shaping,
  preserving default feature merging, and namespacing shaped-run cache entries
  by feature set. Fallback visual output, bitmap/color thickening edge cases,
  glyph metrics, broader font pixel parity, and GUI-visible A/B font rendering
  remain in `RUNTIME-007B2B2B2B`.
- **Window padding layout is renderer size state.** Experiment 148 split
  deterministic `window-padding-x`/`window-padding-y` scaling,
  `window-padding-balance` math, active live renderer padded `Size`/grid wiring,
  and padded PTY row/column state out of the renderer GUI gap. After Experiment
  151, non-glass compositor opacity, GUI cursor pixels, custom shader output,
  broader GUI/pixel parity, and screenshot-level padding pixel proof remain in
  `RUNTIME-008B2B2B2`.
- **macOS glass blur/opacity lives in the copied app host.** Experiment 151
  proved that `TerminalViewContainer.swift` is identical to pinned Ghostty after
  expected Ghostty-to-Roastty renames, including `NSGlassEffectView`,
  `macosGlassRegular`, `macosGlassClear`, background opacity tinting, corner
  radius, inactive tint overlay, and safe-area top-inset handling. Non-glass
  compositor opacity, GUI cursor pixels, custom shader output, broader GUI/
  pixel parity, and screenshot-level padding pixel proof remain in
  `RUNTIME-008B2B2B2`.
- **Non-glass opacity also lives in the copied macOS host.** Experiment 154
  proved `TerminalWindow.swift`, `TransparentTitlebarTerminalWindow.swift`, and
  `QuickTerminalController.swift` are rename-equivalent to pinned Ghostty and
  preserve background opacity thresholding, fullscreen/opaque-toggle
  suppression, the 0.001 white background workaround, non-glass blur ABI calls,
  preferred background alpha clamping, titlebar forwarding, and quick-terminal
  opacity handling. GUI cursor pixels, custom shader output, broader GUI/pixel
  parity, and screenshot-level padding pixel proof remain in
  `RUNTIME-008B2B2B2B`.
- **Command palette runtime plumbing can be proven without a full GUI
  walkthrough.** Experiment 152 split copied command palette source parity,
  toggle notification delivery, `commandPaletteIsShowing` state, focus return,
  keyboard-event shielding, config-derived custom command options, unsupported
  action filtering, shortcut display, and hosted action dispatch out of the
  macOS app gap. Windows, tabs, splits, menus, titlebar, fullscreen, quick
  terminal, broader command palette GUI/pixel/input navigation, and full app
  walkthrough evidence remain in `RUNTIME-011B`.
- **Font variations are style-specific font descriptors.** Experiment 149 split
  deterministic `font-variation*` config propagation out of the remaining font
  renderer gap by threading the four parsed variation lists into regular, bold,
  italic, and bold-italic discovery descriptors, splitting font-grid keys by
  variation values, preserving deferred CoreText face application, and carrying
  pinned Ghostty's styled variation retry. Remaining font renderer work stays in
  `RUNTIME-007B2B2B2B`.
- **Font metric modifiers are grid metrics state.** Experiment 150 split
  deterministic `adjust-*` metric modifier propagation out of the remaining font
  renderer gap by threading all 13 parsed modifiers into font-grid keys and
  `Collection::update_metrics`, preserving empty-set defaults, and proving
  modified grid metrics from `build_grid_from_config`. Remaining font renderer
  work stays in `RUNTIME-007B2B2B2B`.
- **Font-size runtime updates should be idempotent.** Experiment 125 found that
  applying an unchanged font size dirtied ABI-only surfaces because
  `set_font_size_points` always requested a render. The setter now returns
  without requesting render when the requested point size is already active,
  preserving real font-change reload behavior while keeping no-op updates quiet.
- **`py_compile` creates bytecode even with `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`.** Treat
  `issues/0805-roastty-ghostty-parity/__pycache__/` as a generated verification
  artifact and remove it after running the inventory script compile check.
- **Full-header ABI gaps must be split into symbol and semantic outcomes.**
  Experiment 5 proved the mapped Ghostty header can be closed at the
  declaration/export level while still recording honest semantic divergences for
  unsupported helpers. Do not hide unsupported behavior behind a passing symbol
  check; put it in `divergences.md` with a guard.
- **Config inventory needs bounded extraction.** Ghostty's `Config.zig` contains
  the real top-level config fields, compatibility aliases, private/internal
  fields, and many later nested enum/helper values in one file. Broad scans
  produce false positives. Use the Experiment 6 helper to inventory only the
  top-level fields before the first `pub fn`, the static compatibility map, and
  Roastty's `pub(crate) struct Config`.
- **Ghostty config compatibility entries are mixed.** Some compatibility map
  entries are true renamed keys (`background-blur-radius`, `adw-toolbar-style`),
  while others are legacy values or removed boolean shims on canonical keys
  (`gtk-tabs-location = hidden`, `macos-dock-drop-behavior = window`, etc.).
  Test the parser effect, not just whether the key name appears.
- **`key-remap` missing values intentionally reset.** Unlike many config
  options, pinned Ghostty's `RemapSet.parseCLI` treats `null`/missing input as
  an empty reset. For Roastty, `key-remap`, `key-remap =`, and `--key-remap`
  should clear the remap set; invalid non-empty remaps should report diagnostics
  without inventing a `ValueRequired` branch.
- **`theme` parser parity is macOS/non-Windows scoped.** Pinned Ghostty routes
  any comma, equals sign, or colon in `theme` through the light/dark pair parser
  on macOS and other non-Windows builds. Its Windows-only drive-letter exception
  for `C:\...` paths is outside Issue 805's copied macOS app parity oracle and
  should be tracked separately if Windows config parity work starts.
- **`keybind` parser parity is parser-surface only.** Experiment 48 proves
  pinned Ghostty `Keybinds.parseCLI` semantics for defaults, clear, root
  bindings, key sequences, chains, tables, slash disambiguation, trigger
  prefixes, diagnostics, CLI, formatting, equality, and clone behavior. Runtime
  shortcut dispatch remains covered by separate keybinding/runtime facets.
- **Default config formatter parity needs an A/B fixture.** Experiment 8 found
  and fixed non-repeatable formatter order drift by comparing pinned Ghostty
  `+show-config --default --no-pager` output to Roastty
  `Config::default().format_config(...)`. After app-name normalization, all 454
  comparable default lines now match exactly; the remaining default-format gaps
  are isolated to `keybind` and `command-palette-entry` repeatable surfaces.
- **Ghostty keybind formatting does not print `performable:` flags.** Experiment
  9 matched pinned Ghostty's default keybind output by preserving the runtime
  performable flags internally while omitting them from formatted config lines,
  using Ghostty's modifier order (`super`, `ctrl`, `alt`, `shift`), and adding
  the physical `digit_1` through `digit_8` aliases that pair with the unicode
  number shortcuts.
- **Default command-palette text actions store semantic UTF-8.** Experiment 10
  matched pinned Ghostty's default command-palette output by storing the
  built-in Ghostty text action as the semantic UTF-8 text payload, letting the
  shared action formatter emit Ghostty's `\xf0\x9f\x91\xbb` bytes instead of
  double-escaping a pre-escaped string.
- **Ghostty's default config output must also parse.** Experiment 11 proved all
  635 pinned Ghostty default config lines are accepted by Roastty's per-line
  parser. The default parser gaps were void codepoint-map reset lines,
  `background-image-opacity`, and keybind triggers where `=` or `+` is both
  syntax and the key.
- **Config parity rows are facet-based.** Experiment 12 decomposed the config
  matrix so canonical option rows prove inventory/default-surface coverage only.
  Remaining config work is tracked by explicit facet `Gap` rows for non-default
  parsers, non-default formatters, diagnostics, validation/finalization,
  precedence/load semantics, reload behavior, and runtime/UI effects.
- **The `link` config option is the first concrete parser dispatch gap.**
  Experiment 13 mapped all 203 canonical config options to Roastty parser rows.
  It found 202 options with identified `Config::set_from_source` dispatch and
  one missing dispatch row: upstream canonical `link`. Pinned Ghostty's
  `RepeatableLink.parseCLI` is itself `NotImplemented`, so the next parser
  experiment must decide and prove the exact equivalent Roastty behavior instead
  of treating `UnknownField` as parity by accident.
- **`link` is recognized-but-unsupported, not unknown.** Experiment 14 matched
  Ghostty's parser shape for canonical `link`: set-but-empty `link =` resets to
  the default link list before parser dispatch, while bare or non-empty `link`
  returns a recognized not-implemented parser error. CFG-217 still remains `Gap`
  because parser-family oracles are not complete, but there are no remaining
  canonical parser dispatch gaps.
- **Ordinary boolean parser rows share one upstream oracle.** Experiment 15
  proved the direct parser semantics for 39 ordinary `set_bool_field` rows:
  upstream true spellings, false spellings, bare true, set-but-empty default
  reset, and invalid values. `config-default-files` remains `Audit covered`
  because its direct parser and effective default-file load-order semantics must
  be proven together under CFG-221.
- **Integer scalar parser rows share one upstream oracle.** Experiment 16 proved
  the direct parser semantics for all 10 integer scalar rows using
  representative `u32`, `usize`, `u64`, `i16`, and `u8` fields: base-0 decimal,
  lowercase and uppercase prefixes, accepted signs, interior underscores,
  set-but-empty reset, missing values, invalid bare signs/prefixes,
  prefix-adjacent underscores, and overflow/range failures.
- **Float scalar parser rows need Zig syntax, not Rust syntax.** Experiment 17
  found and fixed concrete Rust/Zig parser differences for direct float fields:
  Zig accepts digit separators and hexadecimal float literals such as `0x1p4`,
  exponentless hex floats, mixed-case signed `nan`/`inf`/`infinity`, and
  overflow to infinities. Roastty now uses a shared Zig-compatible float helper
  for the 9 float scalar parser rows.
- **Direct string parser rows copy bytes exactly.** Experiment 18 matched
  Ghostty's `[]const u8` / `[:0]const u8` type-magic behavior for the 9 string
  scalar rows: missing values are required, explicit empty strings are accepted
  at the child parser level, `key =` resets through the surrounding dispatch
  helper, and embedded NUL bytes are preserved instead of rejected.
- **Duration parser rows share one upstream grammar.** Experiment 19 proved the
  4 duration parser rows against Ghostty's `Duration.parseCLI` shape: all units,
  longest-unit matching, adjacent and whitespace-separated segments, trailing
  whitespace, bare zero, malformed values, missing values, required/optional
  empty-reset behavior, product-overflow saturation, and over-wide decimal
  literal rejection.
- **Path parser rows must use option-boundary semantics.** Experiment 20 proved
  the 3 path parser rows against Ghostty's `?Path` plus `Path.parseCLI` and
  `RepeatablePath.parseCLI` behavior: leading `?` optional markers, quoted
  literal `?` paths, parsed-empty single-path no-ops, raw-empty resets,
  repeatable accumulation/clearing, formatter output, and embedded NUL
  acceptance at the parser layer.
- **`working-directory` parser rows are parser-only before finalization.**
  Experiment 21 proved the direct parser boundary for `working-directory`: ASCII
  whitespace trimming, surrounding quote stripping, exact lowercase
  `home`/`inherit` keywords, path fallback for all other strings, embedded NUL
  acceptance, raw-empty optional reset, and formatter output. Home expansion and
  probable-CLI defaults remain separate non-parser facets.
- **`command-palette-entry` parser parity is repeatable auto-struct parity.**
  Experiment 22 proved the direct parser boundary for `command-palette-entry`:
  missing/raw-empty values restore the default list, exact `clear` empties it,
  valid entries append through auto-struct parsing, quoted commas are preserved,
  duplicate fields use the last value, actions are canonicalized, invalid
  fields/actions/quotes/escapes are rejected, and formatter output repeats one
  line per entry.
- **Window padding parser rows share one pair parser.** Experiment 23 proved the
  direct parser boundary for `window-padding-x` and `window-padding-y`: one
  base-10 `u32` applies to both sides, comma-separated pairs set each side, only
  spaces and tabs are trimmed around values, raw-empty option values reset to
  defaults, invalid numeric/pair forms are rejected, and formatter output
  collapses equal sides to one value.
- **Packed flag parser rows share one packed-struct parser.** Experiment 24
  proved the direct parser boundary for the 9 packed-flags rows: standalone
  Ghostty bool spellings set every flag, comma lists start from struct defaults,
  `no-` prefixes disable named flags, only spaces and tabs are trimmed around
  comma parts, hyphenated field names are exact, duplicate flags use the later
  token, raw-empty option values reset to defaults, invalid tokens are rejected,
  diagnostics preserve earlier valid values, and formatter output follows
  upstream field order.
- **Unsupported parser rows can still be oracle-complete.** Experiment 25
  promoted canonical `link` by proving pinned Ghostty's current
  `RepeatableLink.parseCLI` boundary: `link` is recognized, bare and non-empty
  values return the not-implemented parser error, raw-empty `link =` resets to
  defaults before parser dispatch, diagnostics preserve that distinction, and
  truly unknown keys still report `UnknownField`.
- **`link` is an intentional no-output formatter row.** Experiment 50 found that
  pinned Ghostty's canonical `link` option has a `RepeatableLink.formatEntry`
  method that intentionally emits nothing because `link` cannot currently be
  set. Formatter inventories and oracles should count `link` as a canonical
  no-output row rather than forcing a nonexistent Roastty
  `Config::format_config` helper.
- **Primitive formatter rows are inventory-family scoped.** Experiment 51
  promoted only rows classified as `boolean`, `integer`, `float`, or `string` in
  `config-formatter-inventory.md`. Rows that happen to use primitive helpers but
  are classified under another family, such as `font`, remain out of scope for
  the primitive oracle and need their own family-specific formatter proof.
- **Metric modifier formatter rows are inventory-family scoped.** Experiment 52
  promoted the 12 non-font rows classified as `metric modifier`. Font-classified
  adjust rows such as `adjust-font-baseline` still need the broader font
  formatter oracle even though they use the same local `format_metric_modifier`
  helper.
- **Window padding formatter rows are a compact independent family.** Experiment
  53 promoted the four rows classified as `window padding`. The formatter oracle
  must cover both compact padding forms (`N` and `left,right`), every balance
  keyword, every padding color keyword, empty resets, and the local order of the
  four rows.
- **Repeatable path formatter classification must use exact options.**
  Experiment 54 found that `custom-shader-animation` was a classifier false
  positive because its Rust identifier contains `custom_shader`; the actual
  repeatable path formatter family is `config-file`, `custom-shader`, and
  `gtk-custom-css`.
- **Color formatter rows are keyword rows in this inventory.** Experiment 55
  promoted `osc-color-report-format` and `window-colorspace`; these are
  keyword/enum-style rows associated with color behavior, not arbitrary RGB
  color formatters. The actual `Config::format_config` order is
  `window-colorspace` before `osc-color-report-format`.
- **Key-remap formatter output is normalized and ordered by remap internals.**
  Experiment 56 promoted the single `key-remap` formatter row. Alias inputs such
  as `control`, `command`, and `option` format as concrete side-specific names,
  and one observed CLI normalized order is `right_ctrl=left_super`,
  `right_alt=left_ctrl`, then `left_ctrl=left_super`.
- **Canonical `link` is a proven no-output formatter row.** Experiment 57
  promoted the single `no-output` formatter row. Pinned Ghostty's
  `RepeatableLink.formatEntry` intentionally emits nothing because `link` cannot
  currently be set; Roastty now has an oracle proving `format_config` emits no
  `link = ` line while adjacent `link-url` still formats normally.
- **Command-palette formatter coverage reuses the parser-family oracle.**
  Experiment 58 promoted the single `command-palette-entry` formatter row using
  existing focused tests that already prove default entries, clear output,
  custom entries, quoted comma values, shorthand actions, reset behavior,
  diagnostics, and exact formatted output.
- **Cleared keybind tables are formatter-silent in pinned Ghostty.** Experiment
  59 found that `foo/` clears a key table, but Ghostty's formatter emits no
  empty `keybind = foo/` line afterward. Roastty now matches that behavior and
  the single `keybind` formatter row is promoted by a dedicated formatter
  oracle.
- **Optional scalar formatter rows are distinct from optional custom rows.**
  Experiment 60 split 11 `entry_optional` rows that recurse into `entry_bool`,
  `entry_int`, or `entry_str` into an `optional scalar` formatter family. These
  rows share void output for `None`, scalar output for `Some`, raw-empty reset
  behavior, and representative declaration-order checks. Optional custom
  `format_entry` rows and font rows remain unpromoted.
- **Optional single-color rows are distinct from optional color-list rows.**
  Experiment 61 promoted 10 optional rows backed by `Color`, `TerminalColor`, or
  `BoldColor`. These rows share void output for `None`, lowercase `#rrggbb`
  output for colors, sentinel keyword output, `bright` bold output, and
  raw-empty reset behavior. `macos-icon-screen-color` remains unpromoted because
  it formats an optional color list.
- **Optional single-path rows are distinct from repeatable path rows.**
  Experiment 62 promoted `background-image` and `bell-audio-path`, which are
  optional `ConfigFilePath` values. Required paths format raw, optional paths
  format with `?`, quoted literal `?path` values remain required paths, parsed
  empty values are no-ops, and raw-empty values reset to void output. Repeatable
  path rows remain covered by Experiment 54.
- **Optional command rows share shell/direct command formatting.** Experiment 63
  promoted `command` and `initial-command`. Shell commands format as their shell
  string, explicit `shell:` prefixes normalize away, direct commands format as
  `direct:` plus space-joined argv items, direct empty payloads format as
  `direct:`, and raw-empty values reset to void output.
- **Optional value rows are a mixed wrapper family.** Experiment 64 promoted
  `auto-update`, `auto-update-channel`, `macos-icon-screen-color`,
  `quit-after-last-window-closed-delay`, `theme`, and `working-directory`. These
  rows share optional void and raw-empty reset behavior, while their inner
  formatters emit enum keywords, comma-joined lowercase color lists, decomposed
  duration strings, single or light/dark theme names, and working-directory
  keywords or paths.
- **Font scalar rows are distinct from complex font rows.** Experiment 65
  promoted `adjust-font-baseline`, `font-size`, `font-thicken`,
  `font-thicken-strength`, `window-inherit-font-size`, and
  `window-title-font-family`. These rows use metric, float, bool, integer, and
  optional string formatter paths; repeatable font families, font features, font
  variations, font styles, font synthetic style, shaping breaks, and codepoint
  maps remain unpromoted.
- **Font repeatable string rows share one-line-per-item formatting.** Experiment
  66 promoted `font-family`, `font-family-bold`, `font-family-italic`,
  `font-family-bold-italic`, and `font-feature`. Empty lists format as one void
  line, populated lists format one line per item in insertion order, raw-empty
  values reset to void output, and strings are byte-preserving.
- **Font style rows share keyword/name and packed-flag formatting.** Experiment
  67 promoted `font-style`, `font-style-bold`, `font-style-italic`,
  `font-style-bold-italic`, and `font-synthetic-style`. `FontStyle` rows format
  `default`, `false`, and named styles exactly, including whitespace-preserving
  names and raw-empty reset to `default`; `FontSyntheticStyle` formats all flags
  with `no-` prefixes for disabled flags and resets to all enabled.
- **Font variation rows share `axis=value` repeatable formatting.** Experiment
  68 promoted `font-variation`, `font-variation-bold`, `font-variation-italic`,
  and `font-variation-bold-italic`. Empty lists format as one void line,
  populated lists format one `axis=value` line per item in insertion order,
  hexadecimal floats normalize to decimal output, infinities and `nan` use
  canonical lowercase display, and raw-empty values reset to void output.
- **Codepoint-map formatter rows share uppercase range formatting.** Experiment
  69 promoted `font-codepoint-map` and `clipboard-codepoint-map`. Empty maps
  format as one void line, populated maps format one `U+XXXX[-U+YYYY]=value`
  line per entry in insertion order, hex codepoints are uppercase and
  zero-padded, font values are descriptor family strings, and clipboard values
  are either `U+XXXX` replacement codepoints or literal strings.
  `font-shaping-break` remains unpromoted because it is a packed flag formatter.
- **`font-shaping-break` is a one-flag packed formatter.** Experiment 70
  promoted `font-shaping-break`. Pinned Ghostty defines only
  `cursor: bool = true`, so the formatter emits `cursor` for the default/enabled
  state and `no-cursor` for the disabled state; standalone boolean parser values
  feed the same formatter output, and raw-empty values reset to `cursor`.
- **Enum parser rows share exact keyword semantics plus compatibility
  branches.** Experiment 26 proved the 52 enum rows: required and optional enum
  fields accept exact keywords only, missing values are required, raw-empty
  values reset to defaults, invalid
  numeric/uppercase/snake-case/whitespace-padded values are rejected,
  diagnostics preserve earlier valid values, and the pinned compatibility
  branches for `macos-dock-drop-behavior = window`,
  `gtk-single-instance = desktop`, and `gtk-tabs-location = hidden` are part of
  the enum-family oracle.
- **Color parser rows share color, terminal-color, and bold-color semantics.**
  Experiment 27 proved the 16 color rows: named colors and hex values parse
  through `Color`, required and optional `TerminalColor` rows accept
  `cell-foreground` and `cell-background`, plain `Color` rows reject those
  sentinels, `BoldColor` accepts `bright`, missing values are required,
  raw-empty values reset to defaults, invalid colors and padded sentinel
  keywords are rejected, diagnostics preserve earlier valid values, and
  formatter output canonicalizes colors to lowercase hex or sentinel keywords.
- **Metric modifier parser rows use Zig numeric syntax.** Experiment 28 proved
  the 13 `parse_metric_modifier` rows: absolute values use Ghostty's
  `std.fmt.parseInt(i32, input, 10)` shape, percentage bodies use
  `std.fmt.parseFloat(f64, ...)`, values at or below `-100%` clamp to `0`,
  special floats such as `nan`, `inf`, and `infinity` are accepted in the
  percentage branch, hexadecimal floats and interior underscores are accepted
  where Zig accepts them, malformed separators and payload NaNs are rejected,
  and formatter output intentionally preserves Zig-style floating precision
  artifacts such as `15.999999999999993%`.
- **Background blur parses bools before radii.** Experiment 29 proved the
  canonical `background-blur` parser row: a bare value sets `true`, `1` and `0`
  are bools rather than radii, exact glass keywords are accepted, non-bool
  numbers parse as base-0 `u8` radii, raw-empty config values reset to the
  default `false`, direct empty parser input is invalid, and malformed numeric
  boundaries such as leading or trailing underscores are rejected while interior
  underscores, including doubled interior underscores, are accepted like Zig.
- **Click repeat interval parser stays separate from finalization.** Experiment
  30 proved canonical `click-repeat-interval`: parser-level values use base-10
  `u32` syntax, raw-empty values reset to `0`, missing values are required,
  whitespace-padded integers and base prefixes are rejected, and `0` remains `0`
  until finalization later resolves the platform/default repeat interval.
- **Cursor style blink is optional bool dispatch.** Experiment 31 proved the
  canonical `cursor-style-blink` parser row: default `null` formats as blank,
  bare/missing values set `true`, raw-empty config values reset to `null`, exact
  Ghostty bool spellings set `true` or `false`, and uppercase words,
  whitespace-padded values, and numeric values outside `0`/`1` are rejected.
- **macOS icon screen colors use ColorList boundaries.** Experiment 32 proved
  canonical `macos-icon-screen-color`: default `null` formats as blank,
  comma-separated named and hex colors format as lowercase hex, spaces and tabs
  are trimmed per token, leading/trailing/doubled comma empty tokens are
  skipped, every parse resets the list, raw-empty config values reset to `null`,
  direct missing or empty child-parser values are required, all-empty or invalid
  lists are rejected, and the 65th color exceeds the upstream 64-color cap.
- **Selection word chars parse through Ghostty string escapes.** Experiment 33
  proved canonical `selection-word-chars`: parsed lists always begin with null,
  explicit empty values are valid and leave only that null boundary, missing
  values are required, literal characters plus `\t`, `\\`, and `\u{...}` escapes
  are accepted, invalid escapes preserve the previous valid list, formatter
  output skips the leading null, invalid Unicode codepoints are skipped, and
  output stops before the upstream 4096-byte buffer cap.
- **Window decoration parses bools before variants.** Experiment 34 proved
  canonical `window-decoration`: direct missing parser input is `auto`, bool
  tokens map true to `auto` and false to `none`, exact variants
  `auto`/`client`/`server`/`none` are accepted, empty strings, unknown values,
  whitespace-padded values, and case-changed values are rejected, and formatting
  emits the canonical keyword.
- **Mouse scroll multiplier uses auto-struct plus Zig floats.** Experiment 35
  proved canonical `mouse-scroll-multiplier`: bare values set both fields,
  auto-struct fields preserve unspecified current values, explicit empty values
  are no-ops, quoted field values are decoded before parsing, Zig float syntax
  such as hex floats, infinities, and NaNs is accepted, malformed structures and
  bad floats are rejected, and finalization/clamping remains a separate facet.
- **Quick terminal size uses Zig numbers in both units.** Experiment 36 proved
  canonical `quick-terminal-size`: pixel values use Zig-compatible base-10 `u32`
  syntax, percentage values use Zig-compatible `f32` syntax, comma-separated
  primary/secondary values trim CLI whitespace, empty config values reset to
  default, invalid units and malformed numbers are rejected, and formatter plus
  representative calculation behavior match the pinned helper.
- **Command parser rejects whole-empty input, not empty prefixed payloads.**
  Experiment 37 proved canonical `command` and `initial-command`: the shared
  parser trims ASCII spaces before prefix detection and rejects only missing,
  empty, or all-space whole inputs; `direct:` / `direct:   ` produce a direct
  command with one empty argument, `shell:` / `shell:   ` produce an empty shell
  command, exact `direct:` and `shell:` prefixes select parser mode, unknown
  colon prefixes remain shell commands, and direct payloads split naively on
  ASCII spaces.
- **Palette parser mutates only after key and color parse.** Experiment 38
  proved canonical `palette`: values require the first `=`, keys trim ASCII
  space/tab and parse with Zig base-0 `u8` syntax, color suffixes parse through
  `Color.parseCLI`, failed key or color parses leave prior palette values and
  mask bits unchanged, explicit empty config values reset to the default palette
  through optional dispatch, and formatting emits all 256 entries.
- **Env parser is RepeatableStringMap semantics.** Experiment 39 proved
  canonical `env`: missing values and whitespace-only direct values are
  required-value errors, an exactly empty value clears the whole map, the first
  `=` splits key from value, ASCII whitespace is trimmed around both sides,
  empty keys are accepted, empty parsed values delete a key, repeated keys
  overwrite, and equality ignores insertion order.
- **Repeatable paths distinguish raw-empty reset from parsed-empty no-op.**
  Experiment 40 proved canonical `custom-shader` and `gtk-custom-css`: missing
  values are required, raw empty values clear the list, required paths append,
  leading `?` paths append as optional, quoted leading `?` paths stay required,
  parsed-empty values `?`, `""`, and `?""` are ignored, formatting emits one
  entry per path, and file/CLI loading expands relative paths against the
  correct base.
- **Input parser validates before tag fallback.** Experiment 41 proved canonical
  `input`: missing values are required, an exactly empty repeatable value clears
  the list, non-empty entries validate with Zig string-literal syntax before any
  append, `raw:` and `path:` select explicit storage, unknown-tag values fall
  back to raw input, `raw:` may carry an empty payload, and invalid entries
  leave the existing list unchanged.
- **Repeatable font strings share one helper with a CLI exception.** Experiment
  42 proved canonical `font-family`, `font-family-bold`, `font-family-italic`,
  `font-family-bold-italic`, and `font-feature`: missing values are required,
  exact empty values clear the list, non-empty values append byte-for-byte,
  `overwrite_next` clears only before the next append and then resets,
  clones/equality ignore `overwrite_next`, CLI font-family values replace file
  values, and CLI font-feature values append normally.
- **Font style parsing treats most input as a name.** Experiment 43 proved
  canonical `font-style`, `font-style-bold`, `font-style-italic`, and
  `font-style-bold-italic`: missing values are required, exact `default` and
  `false` tokens select their special variants, every other supplied value is a
  named style without trimming or validation, direct empty input is an empty
  name, while set-but-empty config dispatch resets the field to `default`.
- **Font variation values use Zig float syntax.** Experiment 44 proved canonical
  `font-variation`, `font-variation-bold`, `font-variation-italic`, and
  `font-variation-bold-italic`: values split on the first `=`, axis ids and
  values trim ASCII space/tab, axis ids must be exactly four bytes, value
  parsing accepts the Zig `f64` space including underscores, hex floats,
  NaN/Inf, overflow, and underflow, invalid values leave the list unchanged, and
  set-but-empty config dispatch resets the repeatable list.
- **Codepoint maps split direct parsing from config reset.** Experiment 45
  proved canonical `font-codepoint-map` and `clipboard-codepoint-map`: direct
  empty input is invalid, set-but-empty config dispatch resets the map, range
  keys use Ghostty's `U+...`/range/comma grammar, font maps store descriptor
  family strings, and clipboard maps preserve pinned Ghostty `u21` behavior for
  non-scalar-but-in-range keys and replacement codepoints.

## Verification

This issue is complete when the matrices prove total accepted parity with
Ghostty commit `2c62d182cec246764ff725096a70b9ef44996f7f`.

The final conclusion must not claim parity from incomplete evidence. If a row
has no deterministic proof, it is not passing. If the behavior is not tested and
not explicitly accepted as a divergence or not-applicable item, the issue
remains open.
