# Experiment 162: Link hover modifier refresh

## Description

Experiment 161 proved deterministic link-hover preview dispatch when the mouse
position changes. Its completion review noted a nearby pinned Ghostty behavior
that remains unproven: Ghostty also refreshes link hover when key/modifier
events change the active mouse modifiers while the cursor stays in place.

Pinned Ghostty commit `2c62d182cec246764ff725096a70b9ef44996f7f` handles this in
`Surface.keyCallback`: when `self.mouse.mods` differs from the incoming key
event modifiers, it calls `modsChanged(event.mods)`, then refreshes links at the
current cursor position if mouse reporting is off or shift overrides reporting.
If mouse reporting is on and shift is not active, Ghostty clears `mouse_shape`
back to the terminal mouse shape and dispatches `mouse_over_link = ""`.

This experiment is intentionally limited to deterministic runtime action
dispatch caused by key/modifier events. It does not claim GUI cursor pixels,
native preview display, or OS behavior.

## Changes

- `roastty/src/lib.rs`
  - Add a key-event modifier refresh path that compares the current mouse mods
    with the remapped key event modifiers.
  - Update surface mouse modifiers through the same binding-modifier semantics
    Ghostty uses for mouse hover.
  - Refresh link hover at the existing mouse position when modifier changes make
    a link eligible, including ctrl/super enabling a regular or OSC8 link while
    the cursor has not moved.
  - Force a link re-evaluation or invalidate the same-cell no-link cache when
    modifiers change, so a stationary modifier press can discover a link at the
    current cell.
  - Match Ghostty's exact reporting branches: refresh when mouse reporting is
    off or when `shift && !mouseShiftCapture(false)`, and clear hover only when
    mouse reporting is active and shift is not active. A reporting state with
    captured shift should neither refresh nor clear.
  - Add focused tests that prove:
    - pressing super while stationary over the default URL link dispatches
      pointer shape and `mouse_over_link`;
    - releasing super while over the same link clears hover;
    - pressing super while stationary over OSC8 text dispatches the OSC8 URL;
    - normal mouse reporting suppresses modifier-driven hover refresh, while
      shift+super allows it through the existing shift override gate.
- `issues/0805-roastty-ghostty-parity/link_hover_modifier_refresh_parity.py`
  - Add a cheap guard for Ghostty anchors, Roastty implementation markers,
    tests, and inventory wording.
- `issues/0805-roastty-ghostty-parity/config_runtime_inventory.py`
  - Update the existing `RUNTIME-012B2B2B2B2B2` complete row so it explicitly
    includes modifier-driven link-hover refresh.
- `issues/0805-roastty-ghostty-parity/README.md`
  - Update the experiment index and Learnings if the experiment discovers
    reusable guidance.

## Verification

- Run the focused Rust tests:

  ```bash
  cargo fmt --manifest-path roastty/Cargo.toml
  ```

  ```bash
  cargo test --manifest-path roastty/Cargo.toml link_hover_modifier_refresh -- --test-threads=1
  ```

- Run the existing hover dispatch tests to ensure the mouse-position path still
  passes:

  ```bash
  cargo test --manifest-path roastty/Cargo.toml link_hover_preview_dispatch -- --test-threads=1
  ```

- Run the new and existing parity guards:

  ```bash
  PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 issues/0805-roastty-ghostty-parity/link_hover_modifier_refresh_parity.py
  PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 issues/0805-roastty-ghostty-parity/link_hover_preview_dispatch_parity.py
  ```

- Regenerate and validate the runtime inventory:

  ```bash
  PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 issues/0805-roastty-ghostty-parity/config_runtime_inventory.py --output issues/0805-roastty-ghostty-parity/config-runtime-inventory.md --matrix issues/0805-roastty-ghostty-parity/config-matrix.md
  ```

The experiment passes if Roastty matches pinned Ghostty's deterministic
key/modifier-driven link hover refresh and clear behavior without broadening the
claim to GUI or OS effects.

## Design Review

**Reviewer:** Kant the 2nd (`019eca9d-733d-7983-bfb4-aea186c9a94e`)

**Result:** Changes required

The first review found two required design issues and one optional hardening
point:

- The clear behavior was too broad. Pinned Ghostty clears in the mouse-reporting
  branch only when shift is not active; reporting with captured shift should
  neither refresh nor clear.
- Verification omitted the required Rust formatting step.
- The design should explicitly require bypassing or invalidating the current
  same-cell no-link cache when modifiers change, otherwise a stationary modifier
  press could be skipped.

The design has been updated to require the exact Ghostty branches, include
`cargo fmt`, and call out the same-cell cache interaction.

**Re-review result:** Approved

The reviewer confirmed the required findings were resolved and approved the
design for implementation.
