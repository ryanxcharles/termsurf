# Experiment 109: Middle Click Action Runtime

## Description

`RUNTIME-004H` remains a mouse runtime gap after Experiment 108. Pinned Ghostty
handles middle-button press according to `middle-click-action`:

- `ignore` does nothing.
- `primary-paste` starts a paste clipboard request. The source clipboard follows
  `copy-on-select`: `copy-on-select = clipboard` reads the standard clipboard,
  while `true` and `false` prefer the selection clipboard and fall back to the
  standard clipboard when the runtime does not support a selection clipboard.

Roastty parses and formats `middle-click-action`, and it already has clipboard
paste request plumbing for explicit paste actions. The missing work is wiring
the middle-button press path to this config and proving the clipboard-selection
decision at runtime.

This experiment will close only `RUNTIME-004H`. It will not implement or claim
`right-click-action` (`RUNTIME-004G`) or `mouse-hide-while-typing`
(`RUNTIME-004F`).

## Changes

- Add `middle_click_action` runtime state to `Surface`, initialize it from app
  config, and refresh it through surface config updates.
- Add a middle-button press branch in `Surface::mouse_button` equivalent to
  pinned Ghostty's `Surface.zig` middle-click handling:
  - run it only after the normal mouse-reporting path declines to consume the
    event, because pinned Ghostty returns from reporting before reaching the
    middle-click paste branch;
  - `MiddleClickAction::Ignore` does not start a clipboard request and leaves
    normal mouse reporting behavior unchanged.
  - `MiddleClickAction::PrimaryPaste` starts a paste request on middle-button
    press.
  - If `copy-on-select = clipboard`, request the standard clipboard.
  - If `copy-on-select` is `true` or `false`, request the selection clipboard
    when the runtime supports it; otherwise request the standard clipboard.
- Reuse `paste_from_clipboard` so paste protection, bracketed paste encoding,
  and clipboard completion behavior stay shared with existing paste actions.
- Add focused pty/runtime tests for:
  - default `primary-paste` with selection clipboard support requests the
    selection clipboard;
  - `copy-on-select = false` with selection clipboard support also requests the
    selection clipboard;
  - default `primary-paste` without selection clipboard support falls back to
    the standard clipboard;
  - `copy-on-select = clipboard` requests the standard clipboard even when the
    selection clipboard is supported;
  - `middle-click-action = ignore` starts no clipboard request;
  - terminal mouse-reporting mode preserves mouse reporting and starts no
    middle-click clipboard request;
  - runtime config update changes an existing surface from `ignore` to
    `primary-paste`.
- Update `config_runtime_inventory.py` so `RUNTIME-004H` becomes
  `Oracle complete` only if the new runtime guards exist.
- Regenerate `config-runtime-inventory.md` and `config-matrix.md`, format the
  generated markdown, and update Issue 805 learnings.

## Verification

Pass criteria:

- Focused tests prove every `middle-click-action` variant and the
  `copy-on-select` clipboard-source decision described above.
- The tests drive `roastty_surface_mouse_button` with
  `ROASTTY_MOUSE_BUTTON_MIDDLE` so they cover the surface mouse path, not only
  parser/config helpers.
- A focused reporting-mode test proves middle-click paste does not bypass
  terminal mouse reporting.
- Existing mouse runtime tests still pass.
- `RUNTIME-004H` is promoted to `Oracle complete`, while `RUNTIME-004F` and
  `RUNTIME-004G` remain `Gap`.
- `CFG-223` remains `Gap`.

## Design Review

Fresh-context Codex adversarial reviewer `Sagan` initially returned **CHANGES
REQUIRED**:

- **Required:** the design did not pin Ghostty's mouse-reporting interaction.
  Pinned Ghostty returns from mouse reporting before reaching the middle-click
  paste branch, so Roastty must not start a middle-click paste request when the
  terminal consumes the middle press as a mouse report.
- **Required:** the concrete tests omitted the non-obvious
  `copy-on-select = false` case, which should still prefer the selection
  clipboard when that clipboard is supported.

Fix:

- The plan now states that middle-click action handling runs only after normal
  mouse reporting declines to consume the event and requires a reporting-mode
  negative test.
- The plan now requires an explicit `copy-on-select = false` test with selection
  clipboard support.

Re-review verdict: **Approved**. The reviewer confirmed both prior findings are
resolved and found no remaining required design issues.
