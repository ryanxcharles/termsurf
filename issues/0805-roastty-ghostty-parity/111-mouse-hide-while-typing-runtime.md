# Experiment 111: Mouse Hide While Typing Runtime

## Description

`RUNTIME-004F` remains the last explicit mouse runtime gap after Experiments
108-110. Pinned Ghostty stores `mouse-hide-while-typing` in surface derived
config, hides the mouse only when a pressed key event carries UTF-8 text, shows
the mouse again on mouse movement, mouse button, or scroll, and shows the mouse
immediately if config reload disables hiding while the mouse is hidden.

Roastty already parses and formats `mouse-hide-while-typing`, exposes
`ROASTTY_ACTION_MOUSE_VISIBILITY`, and the macOS app already maps that action to
`SurfaceView.setCursorVisibility`. The missing parity surface is the libroastty
runtime state and event ordering that emits those visibility actions.

This experiment will close only `RUNTIME-004F`. It will not claim broader macOS
GUI cursor visibility workflows, link hover shape behavior, renderer visual
effects, or other CFG-223 runtime rows.

## Changes

- Add `mouse_hide_while_typing` and a hidden/visible mouse runtime state to
  `Surface`, initialize it from app config, and refresh it on surface config
  update.
- Add small `hide_mouse` / `show_mouse` helpers equivalent to pinned Ghostty:
  - `hide_mouse` is idempotent and emits `ROASTTY_ACTION_MOUSE_VISIBILITY` with
    hidden for the surface target.
  - `show_mouse` is idempotent and emits `ROASTTY_ACTION_MOUSE_VISIBILITY` with
    visible for the surface target.
- In `Surface::key`, hide the mouse only when:
  - `mouse-hide-while-typing` is enabled;
  - the key action is press;
  - the mouse is currently visible;
  - the event has non-empty UTF-8 text.
- Preserve pinned Ghostty ordering around key handling: keybindings and VT KAM
  can consume input before the typing-hide branch, but unconsumed or
  performable-unperformed bindings still fall through to the hide branch before
  encoding. The implementation must put the hide decision in a shared
  post-binding/pre-encoding point instead of only the no-binding path.
- Show the mouse again before handling mouse position, mouse button, and mouse
  scroll events, matching pinned Ghostty's `mousePos`, `mouseButtonCallback`,
  and `scrollCallback` behavior.
- During surface config update, if hiding is disabled while the mouse is hidden,
  show it immediately.
- Extend the test action recorder or add a typed action helper so tests assert
  both `ROASTTY_ACTION_MOUSE_VISIBILITY` and its payload: `ROASTTY_MOUSE_HIDDEN`
  or `ROASTTY_MOUSE_VISIBLE`.
- Add focused runtime tests that use the action callback recorder to prove:
  - disabled config never emits mouse visibility for typed text;
  - enabled config hides once on a text key press and does not duplicate hidden
    actions on subsequent text presses while already hidden;
  - a text key with an unconsumed or performable-unperformed configured binding
    still emits hidden before the key is encoded;
  - key release does not hide the mouse;
  - press events without UTF-8 text do not hide the mouse;
  - mouse position, mouse button, and mouse scroll each show a hidden mouse
    again;
  - config update from enabled/hidden to disabled emits visible and changes
    subsequent text-key behavior on the existing surface.
- Update `config_runtime_inventory.py` so `RUNTIME-004F` becomes
  `Oracle complete` only if the focused runtime guard exists.
- Regenerate `config-runtime-inventory.md` and `config-matrix.md`, format the
  generated markdown, and update Issue 805 learnings.

## Verification

Pass criteria:

- Focused tests drive the public surface entry points: `roastty_surface_key`,
  `roastty_surface_mouse_pos`, `roastty_surface_mouse_button`, and
  `roastty_surface_mouse_scroll`.
- Tests prove the exact key-event gates: enabled config, key press, non-empty
  UTF-8 text, and idempotent hide behavior.
- Tests prove the Ghostty key-path placement by covering a text key that matches
  an unconsumed or performable-unperformed configured binding and still reaches
  hide-before-encode behavior.
- Tests assert the mouse visibility action payloads, not just the action tag.
- Tests prove the three mouse event families restore visibility from hidden:
  movement, button, and scroll.
- A config-update test proves disabling `mouse-hide-while-typing` on an existing
  hidden surface emits visible and prevents later text-key hides.
- Existing mouse runtime and key tests still pass.
- `RUNTIME-004F` is promoted to `Oracle complete`.
- `CFG-223` remains `Gap`.

## Design Review

Fresh-context Codex adversarial reviewer `Epicurus` initially returned **CHANGES
REQUIRED**:

- **Required:** the design could pass while placing the hide decision only on
  the no-binding key path. Pinned Ghostty runs keybinding handling first, but
  unconsumed or performable-unperformed bindings still fall through to the
  hide-before-encode branch.
- **Optional:** the design did not require test recorder support for
  `ROASTTY_ACTION_MOUSE_VISIBILITY` payloads, so tests could assert only the
  action tag and miss hidden/visible inversions.

Fix:

- The design now requires the hide decision to live at a shared
  post-binding/pre-encoding point and requires a configured-binding fallthrough
  test.
- The design now requires extending the action recorder or adding a typed helper
  so tests assert `ROASTTY_MOUSE_HIDDEN` and `ROASTTY_MOUSE_VISIBLE` payloads.

Re-review verdict: **Approved**. The reviewer confirmed the prior required and
optional findings are resolved and found no remaining required design issues.
