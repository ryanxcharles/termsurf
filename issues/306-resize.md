# TermSurf 3.0 Resize Support

## Background

This document continues from [305-profile.md](./305-profile.md), which fixed
profile isolation so each `--profile` value creates a separate CEF data
directory at `~/.config/termsurf/cef/<profile>/`.

### What We Accomplished (ts3-5)

One experiment fixed the profile path from `~/Library/Application Support/` to
`~/.config/termsurf/cef/` by replacing `dirs_next::config_dir()` with
`$HOME/.config/termsurf/cef/`. Verified that `default`, `test1`, and `test2`
profiles each create separate directories.

### Current Limitations

The webview renders at a hardcoded 800x600 logical pixels with a hardcoded 2.0
device scale factor. This means:

1. The rendered page doesn't match the pane size -- it's always 800x600
   regardless of how large or small the pane is.
2. Resizing the window or splitting panes doesn't re-render the page at the new
   size.
3. The scale factor assumes Retina (2x) on all displays.

### New Goal

Make the webview render at the correct size and re-render when the pane resizes.

**Success looks like:**

- Opening `web google.com` renders at the actual pane size, not 800x600
- Resizing the window re-renders the page at the new size
- Splitting panes (reducing space) re-renders at the smaller size
- Retina displays render at 2x, non-Retina at 1x (determined dynamically)

## Research: How ts2 Solved This

ts2 had CEF in-process, so the render handler had direct access to pane
dimensions via `Rc<RefCell<(u32, u32)>>`. ts3 has CEF in a separate process, so
dimensions must be communicated via XPC. But the CEF-side logic is the same.

### Retina / Device Scale Factor

ts2 converts physical pixels to logical pixels for CEF:

```rust
// ts2/wezterm-gui/src/termwindow/render/pane.rs (lines 845-848)
const MACOS_BASE_DPI: f32 = 72.0;
let device_scale_factor = self.dimensions.dpi as f32 / MACOS_BASE_DPI;
let logical_width = (width / device_scale_factor) as u32;
let logical_height = (browser_height / device_scale_factor) as u32;
```

CEF works in logical pixels. `view_rect()` returns the logical size, and
`screen_info()` returns the device scale factor. CEF internally multiplies
logical size by scale factor to get the physical IOSurface size.

For example, on a Retina display (DPI 144, scale factor 2.0):

- Pane is 1600x1200 physical pixels
- `view_rect()` reports 800x600 logical
- `screen_info()` reports `device_scale_factor = 2.0`
- CEF renders a 1600x1200 IOSurface

ts2's `screen_info` reads from a stored `device_scale_factor` field:

```rust
// ts2/wezterm-gui/src/cef_browser/mod.rs (lines 584-592)
fn screen_info(&self, _browser: Option<&mut Browser>,
               screen_info: Option<&mut ScreenInfo>) -> i32 {
    if let Some(screen_info) = screen_info {
        screen_info.device_scale_factor = self.handler.device_scale_factor;
        return 1;
    }
    0
}
```

### Dynamic view_rect

ts2 reads size from a shared `Rc<RefCell<(u32, u32)>>`:

```rust
// ts2/wezterm-gui/src/cef_browser/mod.rs (lines 567-579)
fn view_rect(&self, _browser: Option<&mut Browser>, rect: Option<&mut Rect>) {
    let (width, height) = *self.handler.size.borrow();
    if let Some(rect) = rect {
        if width > 0 && height > 0 {
            rect.width = width as i32;
            rect.height = height as i32;
        }
    }
}
```

### Resize Flow

When the pane size changes, ts2 calls `browser.resize()`:

```rust
// ts2/wezterm-gui/src/cef_browser/mod.rs (lines 262-291)
pub fn resize(&self, width: u32, height: u32) {
    *self.size.borrow_mut() = (width, height);
    if let Some(host) = self.host() {
        host.was_resized();        // Tell CEF viewport changed
        host.invalidate(...);      // Force repaint
        do_message_loop_work();    // Process immediately (ts2 pumps manually)
    }
}
```

`host.was_resized()` causes CEF to call `view_rect()` again to get the new size,
then re-render at that size. The next `on_accelerated_paint` delivers a new
IOSurface at the updated dimensions.

### The Bouncing Problem and Settle Delay

ts2 had a "bouncing" problem: during continuous window resize (dragging the
edge), the texture would bounce around and often settle in the wrong position.
The root cause was never fully diagnosed, but rapid resize events caused texture
mismatches -- CEF may still be rendering a previous frame when the next resize
arrives.

ts2 solved this with a **settle-and-rerender** pattern: wait for the resize to
stop, then do one final resize at the settled size. The actual delay was
**30ms** (the documentation said 10ms but the code used 30ms).

```rust
// ts2/wezterm-gui/src/termwindow/render/pane.rs (line 820)
const SETTLE_DELAY: Duration = Duration::from_millis(30);
```

The logic, called every paint frame:

```rust
// ts2/wezterm-gui/src/termwindow/render/pane.rs (lines 852-876)

// 1. If target size changed, mark the time
if browser.get_pending_size() != Some(target_size) {
    browser.set_pending_size(logical_width, logical_height);
    browser.mark_resize_time();
}

// 2. If timer is running, check if we've settled
if let Some(elapsed) = browser.time_since_last_resize() {
    if elapsed >= SETTLE_DELAY {
        // 30ms with no size change -- do the resize
        browser.resize(logical_width, logical_height);
        browser.clear_resize_time();
        browser.clear_pending_size();
    } else {
        // Still settling -- keep painting to check again next frame
        window.invalidate();
    }
}
```

**For ts3:** We prefer continuous resize (no delay). The settle delay is a
fallback if the bouncing problem recurs.

### Key Difference: ts3 Doesn't Need do_message_loop_work()

ts2 used `do_message_loop_work()` to pump CEF's event queue from the GUI's event
loop. ts3 doesn't need this -- the profile server runs `cef::run_message_loop()`
in its own process, so CEF processes events (including resize) automatically.

## Architecture

### XPC Connection Topology

```
GUI Process                           Profile Server Process
    |                                         |
    |-- XpcListener (anonymous) ----+         |
    |                               |         |
    |   [launcher relays endpoint]  |         |
    |                               v         |
    |                    Profile connects ---->|
    |                               |         |
    |<-- profile_conn (accepted) ---+         |
    |                                         |
    |--- send("resize", w, h) ------------->  |  (NEW: GUI to profile)
    |                                         |
    |<-- send("display_surface", port) -----  |  (existing: profile to GUI)
```

The profile server already connects directly to the GUI (via the launcher's
endpoint relay). The GUI accepts this connection in its
`new_connection_handler`. Currently the GUI only **receives** on this
connection. To send resize messages, the GUI needs to **store a reference to the
accepted connection** and use it to send messages back.

On the profile side, the event handler on the GUI connection currently only
sends -- it doesn't listen for incoming messages. Adding a `set_event_handler`
on the profile's GUI connection would let it receive resize messages.

### Data Flow for Initial Size

```
web CLI --("open_webview", url, profile)--> GUI
    GUI computes pane pixel dimensions and DPI
    GUI sends spawn_profile to launcher with width, height, scale
    Launcher spawns: termsurf-profile --width W --height H --scale S ...
    Profile uses W, H, S in view_rect() and screen_info()
```

### Data Flow for Resize

```
Window resize / pane split detected by GUI
    GUI computes new pane pixel dimensions
    GUI converts to logical: logical = physical / scale_factor
    GUI sends XPC message: { action: "resize", width: W, height: H }
    Profile receives, updates stored size
    Profile calls host.was_resized()
    CEF calls view_rect() -> returns new size
    CEF re-renders at new size
    on_accelerated_paint fires with new IOSurface
    Profile sends new IOSurface to GUI
    GUI renders updated texture
```

## Tasks

- [x] Pass initial pane size from GUI through launcher to profile server
- [x] Make view_rect() and screen_info() read from dynamic shared state
- [ ] Add bidirectional XPC: GUI sends resize messages to profile server
- [ ] Profile server receives resize messages and calls `was_resized()`
- [ ] GUI detects pane resize and sends new dimensions to profile
- [ ] Verify resize works when expanding/shrinking the window
- [ ] Verify resize works when splitting panes
- [ ] (If needed) Add settle delay to prevent bouncing

## Experiments

### Experiment 1: Pass Initial Size at Startup

**Status:** SUCCESS

**Goal:** Remove the hardcoded 800x600 and 2.0 scale factor. Pass the actual
pane dimensions and DPI from the GUI to the profile server at spawn time.

**Result:** The webview now renders at the actual pane size. The GUI looks up
pane pixel dimensions via `Mux::try_get()` → `get_pane()` → `get_dimensions()`,
computes logical size and scale factor, and passes them through the launcher to
the profile server as CLI args. The profile server's `view_rect()` and
`screen_info()` read from shared state instead of hardcoded values.

#### Changes

**1. Add CLI args to profile server**

**File:** `ts3/termsurf-profile/src/main.rs`

Add `--width`, `--height`, and `--scale` to the `Args` struct:

```rust
#[derive(Parser)]
struct Args {
    #[arg(long)]
    profile: String,

    #[arg(long)]
    url: String,

    #[arg(long)]
    session_id: String,

    #[arg(long)]
    width: u32,

    #[arg(long)]
    height: u32,

    #[arg(long)]
    scale: f32,
}
```

Store width, height, and scale in `SharedState`:

```rust
struct SharedState {
    gui: std::sync::Arc<XpcConnection>,
    url: String,
    width: std::sync::atomic::AtomicU32,
    height: std::sync::atomic::AtomicU32,
    scale: f32,  // Immutable after startup (for now)
}
```

Use atomics so the render handler can read without a lock.

Update `view_rect()` to read from shared state:

```rust
fn view_rect(&self, _browser: Option<&mut Browser>, rect: Option<&mut Rect>) {
    if let Some(rect) = rect {
        rect.width = self.inner.state.width.load(Ordering::Relaxed) as i32;
        rect.height = self.inner.state.height.load(Ordering::Relaxed) as i32;
    }
}
```

Update `screen_info()` to read from shared state:

```rust
fn screen_info(&self, _browser: Option<&mut Browser>,
               screen_info: Option<&mut ScreenInfo>) -> i32 {
    if let Some(info) = screen_info {
        info.device_scale_factor = self.inner.state.scale;
        return 1;
    }
    0
}
```

**2. GUI computes pane dimensions and passes them through**

**File:** `ts3/wezterm-gui/src/termwindow/webview_socket.rs`

In the `open_webview` handler, compute the pane pixel dimensions and DPI. This
requires access to `TermWindow`'s `dimensions` and `render_metrics`. Pass width,
height, and scale to `request_profile_spawn()`.

**File:** `ts3/wezterm-gui/src/termwindow/webview_xpc.rs`

Add `width`, `height`, `scale` parameters to `request_profile_spawn()`. Include
them in the `spawn_profile` XPC message to the launcher.

**File:** `ts3/termsurf-launcher/src/main.rs`

Read `width`, `height`, `scale` from the `spawn_profile` message and pass them
as CLI args when spawning the profile server.

#### Verification

```bash
cd ts3
./scripts/build-debug.sh --open

# Open webview -- should render at pane size, not 800x600
web google.com

# Check profile log for actual dimensions:
cat /tmp/termsurf-profile-*.log | grep "Cache\|view_rect\|coded_size"
```

#### Success Criteria

- [x] Profile log shows dimensions matching the pane size, not 800x600
- [x] IOSurface dimensions in the log match the pane physical pixel size
- [x] Page renders at the correct size (fills the pane, not too small or large)

## Conclusion

### What We Accomplished

Experiment 1 succeeded: the browser now opens at the correct pane dimensions
instead of hardcoded 800x600. The full pipeline works -- the GUI reads pane
pixel dimensions and DPI from the Mux, computes logical size and scale factor,
passes them through the launcher to the profile server as CLI args, and CEF's
`view_rect()` and `screen_info()` read from shared state. The rendered page
fills the pane correctly on Retina displays.

### Critical Discovery: One-Process-Per-Profile Was Forgotten

While planning the remaining resize work, we discovered a fundamental oversight:
**the current code completely ignores the one-process-per-profile constraint
that is the entire reason ts3 exists.**

The code today spawns a new `termsurf-profile` process for every `web` command.
If a user opens two webviews with the same profile (e.g., `web google.com` and
`web github.com` both using the `default` profile), the second process will
crash or fail because CEF's `SingletonLock` prevents two processes from opening
the same `root_cache_path`. This is not a minor bug -- it is a violation of the
foundational architectural constraint of ts3.

The correct behavior: there must be exactly one `termsurf-profile` process per
profile. When a second `web` command arrives for an already-running profile, the
launcher must detect the existing process and send it a "create browser" command
instead of spawning a new one. The profile server must manage multiple webviews
within a single CEF process, each with its own size, URL, and IOSurface -- like
tabs in a browser.

### Change of Course

All remaining work in this document (bidirectional resize, settle delay) and all
other unfinished features (keyboard input, mouse input, navigation, multiple
pages, page lifecycle, DevTools) are blocked until the one-process-per-profile
architecture is implemented. Without it, opening a second webview with the same
profile will crash, making every other feature irrelevant.

**Next document:** Fix the one-process-per-profile architecture before returning
to resize, input, or any other feature work.
