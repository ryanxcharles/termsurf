# Issue 816: Ghostboard Browser State and Interruption Walkthrough

## Goal

Prove or reject the medium-likelihood browser-state and interruption-flow gaps
from Issue 810.

## Background

Issue 810 grouped these as `Maybe` findings. Static or partial evidence exists
for many paths through direct Roamium sockets, but Ghostboard runtime proof is
missing for the full walkthrough.

Covered behaviors include:

- loading state;
- page title;
- hover target URL;
- console messages;
- JavaScript dialogs;
- HTTP auth;
- renderer crash recovery;
- color scheme;
- target blank;
- refresh/reload;
- copy-current-URL;
- default white page background.

## Analysis

This issue should start as a walkthrough and regression-design issue. It should
only fix app code after a focused experiment proves a specific missing behavior.
Because many flows are engine- or webtui-owned, each finding must identify the
owning component before any fix.

## Experiments

- [Experiment 1: Prove direct browser state smoke](01-prove-direct-browser-state-smoke.md)
  — **Partial** (initial load reports `progress`/`done` but not literal
  `loading`)
