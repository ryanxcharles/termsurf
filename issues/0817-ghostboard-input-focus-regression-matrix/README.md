# Issue 817: Ghostboard Input and Focus Regression Matrix

## Goal

Design and run a focused Ghostboard input/focus regression matrix, then fix any
confirmed Ghostboard-owned gaps.

## Background

Issue 810 grouped input and focus as a `Maybe` finding. Current code has
keyboard, mouse, scroll, mode, and focus paths, and Issue 809 covered important
geometry/input cases, but the historical archive shows that browser input needs
more complete coverage.

The matrix should cover:

- keyboard text input and special keys;
- Cmd/menu shortcuts;
- clipboard behavior;
- mode transitions;
- focus stealing and pane focus;
- dimming or inactive visual feedback;
- caret visibility;
- mouse click, hover, scroll, double-click, triple-click, modifier-click;
- drag selection and terminal-selection suppression;
- mouse hot-path performance.

## Analysis

The first experiments should establish reliable automation and pass/fail
criteria. The matrix should stay small enough to run repeatedly, with slower
manual or screenshot-heavy cases separated from fast smoke tests.

## Experiments

- [Experiment 1: Establish input/focus baseline matrix](01-establish-input-focus-baseline.md)
  — **Partial**
- [Experiment 2: Prove browser input granularity](02-prove-browser-input-granularity.md)
  — **Partial**
- [Experiment 3: Fix browser drag forwarding](03-fix-browser-drag-forwarding.md)
  — **Designed**
