# Issue 789: Electron-Style PDF Viewer Infrastructure

## Goal

Make PDFs render inline in Roamium by adding the Electron-style Chromium
embedder infrastructure that the PDF viewer requires.

This issue continues from Issue 776. Issue 776 proved that PDF rendering is not
fixed by a single PDFium plugin toggle, wrapper page, MIME mapping, or direct
link to Chrome's full browser implementation. TermSurf needs its own small
embedder layer that mirrors the pieces Electron provides for Chromium's PDF
viewer path.

## Background

Opening a PDF with `web file.pdf` currently does not render a working inline PDF
viewer. Issue 776 investigated the failure and established several facts:

- Roamium is based on Chromium's `content_shell`-style embedding, so it does not
  automatically inherit Chrome's full PDF viewer feature stack.
- The internal PDF plugin can be registered and created, but that is not enough.
- A wrapper-only approach can load static viewer resources, but it does not
  enter Chromium's real PDF stream / PDF renderer pipeline.
- Chromium can manage the PDF renderer process itself once the embedder enters
  the proper PDF viewer path. TermSurf should not manually spawn or manage a
  separate PDF process.
- Directly linking Chrome's stock `PluginResponseInterceptorURLLoaderThrottle`
  path is too broad for Roamium. Issue 776 Experiment 8 showed that adding
  `//chrome/browser/plugins:impl` pulled in large Chrome product subsystems and
  failed at link time.

The important architectural lesson from Issue 776 is that Electron is the right
model. Electron does not make itself Chrome. It provides Electron-owned glue for
the PDF viewer pieces that Chrome normally owns, then patches Chromium's PDF
stream path to call Electron's implementations.

TermSurf should do the same for Roamium.

## Electron Model

Electron's PDF implementation has several important pieces:

- `ElectronContentClient` registers the internal PDF plugin.
- `RendererClientBase::RenderFrameCreated()` binds
  `MimeHandlerViewContainerManager` in renderer frames.
- `RendererClientBase::IsPluginHandledExternally()` routes `application/pdf`
  through `MimeHandlerViewContainerManager::CreateFrameContainer()`.
- `ElectronBrowserClient::CreateURLLoaderThrottles()` installs
  `PluginResponseInterceptorURLLoaderThrottle`.
- Electron carries a Chromium patch that redirects Chrome's plugin response
  interceptor from Chrome's `streams_private` API to Electron's
  `streams_private` API.
- Electron's `streams_private` implementation receives intercepted PDF streams
  and feeds `PdfViewerStreamManager`.
- Electron serves PDF viewer extension resources with an Electron-owned
  component extension resource manager.
- Electron provides enough `pdf_viewer_private` and `PdfHost` /
  `PDFDocumentHelper` glue for the PDF viewer shell and plugin to run.

The key pattern is ownership: Electron copies or adapts the embedder-facing glue
instead of importing Chrome's whole browser layer.

## TermSurf Direction

TermSurf should add a Roamium-owned PDF viewer embedder layer under
`content/libtermsurf_chromium/` and nearby TermSurf-specific Chromium files.

The target architecture is:

1. Keep the internal PDF plugin registration from Issue 776.
2. Keep the static PDF viewer resource serving from Issue 776 Experiment 7.
3. Replace the failed direct Chrome dependency from Issue 776 Experiment 8 with
   a TermSurf-owned PDF response throttle or a narrow Chromium patch that calls
   TermSurf-owned code.
4. Add a TermSurf `streams_private` equivalent that stores intercepted PDF
   streams in `PdfViewerStreamManager`.
5. Add the renderer-side MimeHandlerView container wiring needed to convert
   `application/pdf` into a PDF viewer frame.
6. Add browser-side PDF URL loader request interception so the viewer's content
   frame can claim the original PDF stream.
7. Add enough `pdf_viewer_private` and `PdfHost` / `PDFDocumentHelper` support
   for the viewer shell to display the PDF.
8. Let Chromium's existing PDF navigation / SiteInstance / renderer launch path
   create the correct PDF renderer role.

## Constraints

- Do not link Chrome's full browser feature stack into Roamium just to get PDFs.
- Do not add `//chrome/browser/plugins:impl` back as the primary solution unless
  a later experiment proves a narrowly bounded form can link without dragging in
  unrelated Chrome product infrastructure.
- Do not enable general user extension support as a side effect of PDF support.
- Do not weaken PDF origin checks or mark ordinary renderers as PDF renderers.
- Do not fake PDF rendering with static HTML, screenshots, external apps, or
  macOS Preview handoff.
- Do not change the TermSurf protocol unless a later experiment proves the PDF
  viewer path needs protocol-level information that cannot be represented inside
  Chromium/Roamium.
- Every Chromium experiment in this issue must use its own branch following the
  project convention.

## Starting Point

The immediate next step is to design Experiment 1 for this issue.

Experiment 1 should be scoped around the first narrow Electron-style layer that
can replace the dead end from Issue 776 Experiment 8:

- study Electron's `streams_private` redirect and implementation in detail;
- design a TermSurf-owned PDF response throttle / `streams_private` handoff that
  avoids `//chrome/browser/plugins:impl`;
- identify the exact Chromium files that must be patched and the exact
  TermSurf-owned files that should receive the copied/adapted behavior;
- define a build verification that proves the new path avoids the dependency
  explosion from Issue 776 Experiment 8 before trying to make PDFs visibly
  render.

This issue should proceed one experiment at a time. Each experiment should land
one coherent layer or prove why that layer must be shaped differently.

## Experiments

### Experiment 1: Design the TermSurf PDF Stream Handoff

#### Description

Design the first Electron-style PDF layer for TermSurf: a narrow PDF response
interception and stream handoff path that replaces Issue 776 Experiment 8's
failed direct dependency on Chrome's
`PluginResponseInterceptorURLLoaderThrottle` implementation.

This is a design/proof experiment, not a rendering experiment. It should produce
the exact implementation plan for Experiment 2, including files, dependencies,
patch points, and verification gates. It should not change Chromium code.

The core question is:

> What is the smallest TermSurf-owned equivalent of Electron's PDF stream
> handoff that can feed `PdfViewerStreamManager` without linking
> `//chrome/browser/plugins:impl` or Chrome's full extension/browser stack?

#### Changes

1. Re-audit the Electron PDF stream path from the local Electron checkout.

   Use the local source only:

   ```bash
   rg "PluginResponseInterceptorURLLoaderThrottle|CreateURLLoaderThrottles|streams_private|PdfViewerStreamManager|PdfURLLoaderRequestInterceptor" \
     vendor/electron/shell vendor/electron/patches
   ```

   Record the precise roles of:
   - `shell/browser/electron_browser_client.cc::CreateURLLoaderThrottles()`;
   - `shell/browser/extensions/api/streams_private/streams_private_api.cc`,
     specifically the narrow `SendExecuteMimeTypeHandlerEvent()` PDF stream
     dispatch helper, not the general Chrome `streams_private` extension API;
   - `shell/browser/plugins/plugin_utils.cc`, because Electron pairs the
     response-interceptor include redirect with its own plugin-utils
     implementation;
   - `patches/chromium/hack_plugin_response_interceptor_to_point_to_electron.patch`;
   - Electron's `PdfURLLoaderRequestInterceptor` wiring;
   - Electron's `PdfHost` / `PDFDocumentHelper` binder only to record that it
     follows stream handoff and is out of scope for Experiment 2.

2. Re-audit the Chromium PDF stream path and GN dependency surface in the
   current Chromium branch.

   Inspect the current upstream implementation and the failed Issue 776
   Experiment 8 patch:

   ```bash
   rg "PluginResponseInterceptorURLLoaderThrottle|SendExecuteMimeTypeHandlerEvent|PdfViewerStreamManager|CreateTemplateMimeHandlerPage|StreamContainer" \
     chromium/src/chrome/browser \
     chromium/src/extensions \
     chromium/src/pdf \
     chromium/src/content/libtermsurf_chromium
   ```

   Also use GN to inspect target ownership and transitive dependencies. Ripgrep
   can find symbols, but GN is the source of truth for whether a design avoids
   the Issue 776 Experiment 8 dependency explosion:

   ```bash
   export PATH="$PWD/chromium/depot_tools:$PATH"
   gn desc chromium/src/out/Default //chrome/browser/plugins:plugins deps
   gn desc chromium/src/out/Default //chrome/browser/plugins:impl deps
   gn desc chromium/src/out/Default //chrome/browser/plugins:impl public_deps
   gn refs chromium/src/out/Default --tree \
     //chrome/browser/plugins/plugin_response_interceptor_url_loader_throttle.cc
   gn desc chromium/src/out/Default //chrome/browser/pdf:pdf_viewer_stream_manager deps
   ```

   The result must record the `//chrome/browser/plugins:plugins` vs.
   `//chrome/browser/plugins:impl` target split and identify which direct deps
   made `:impl` too broad for Roamium.

   Identify the smallest pieces needed to:
   - detect an `application/pdf` response;
   - replace the PDF response body with the PDF viewer embedder/template
     response, if still required;
   - transfer the original PDF response body into a `StreamContainer`;
   - call `PdfViewerStreamManager::Create()` and `AddStreamContainer()`;
   - avoid `PluginUtils::GetExtensionIdForMimeType()` and real
     `ExtensionRegistry` lookup for the PDF-only first pass.

3. Audit the current TermSurf Chromium branch state.

   Issue 776 Experiment 8 left a committed Chromium branch that may already
   contain partial PDF interceptor patches. Before choosing a design, record the
   current branch and the exact PDF-related patch state:

   ```bash
   git -C chromium/src branch --show-current
   git -C chromium/src log --oneline -5
   git -C chromium/src diff --name-only 148.0.7778.97-issue-776-exp7..HEAD
   rg "issue-776-exp8|pdf_only|PluginResponseInterceptorURLLoaderThrottle|TsPdfNavigationThrottle" \
     chromium/src/chrome/browser/plugins \
     chromium/src/content/libtermsurf_chromium
   ```

   The result must decide, per existing patch:
   - keep as-is;
   - modify in Experiment 2;
   - revert in Experiment 2 because it belongs to the failed direct-link path.

   Also record the starting state of `TsPdfNavigationThrottle`: whether the old
   Issue 776 wrapper cancellation path is active, disabled, or partially
   disabled.

4. Run a baseline Chromium build check.

   Before designing the next implementation, confirm whether the current
   Chromium branch links:

   ```bash
   export PATH="$PWD/chromium/depot_tools:$PATH"
   autoninja -C chromium/src/out/Default libtermsurf_chromium
   ```

   If the baseline build fails because the current branch still contains the
   Issue 776 Experiment 8 dependency/link failure, record that explicitly.
   Experiment 2's branch base must then be a buildable branch before the failed
   dependency path, or must include an explicit revert of the failed path as its
   first implementation step.

5. Produce a dependency map.

   Compare three candidate implementation shapes:
   - **A. Copy the stock Chrome interceptor into `content/libtermsurf_chromium/`
     and strip it to PDF-only.**
   - **B. Patch the stock Chromium interceptor to call a TermSurf
     `SendExecuteMimeTypeHandlerEvent` / PDF stream-dispatch shim, following
     Electron's patch, and pair it with a TermSurf/Electron-style plugin-utils
     fork as needed. Do not link `//chrome/browser/plugins:impl` directly.**
   - **C. Implement a fresh TermSurf `blink::URLLoaderThrottle` that performs
     only the PDF-specific interception and stream handoff.**

   For each candidate, document:
   - Chromium files touched;
   - TermSurf-owned files added;
   - BUILD.gn deps required;
   - downstream pinned deps that remain even after avoiding
     `//chrome/browser/plugins:impl`, including `StreamContainer`,
     `MimeHandlerViewAttachHelper`, `PdfViewerStreamManager`, and
     `TransferrableURLLoader`;
   - whether it depends on `chrome/browser/plugins`,
     `chrome/browser/extensions`, `extensions/browser`, `MimeHandlerViewGuest`,
     or `GuestViewManager`;
   - which existing Issue 776 Experiment 8 patches it keeps, modifies, or
     reverts;
   - why it should or should not avoid the Issue 776 Experiment 8 dependency
     explosion.

   The result table must include:

   | Candidate | Files | New deps | Pinned downstream deps | Broad Chrome deps? | Exp 8 patch disposition | Decision |
   | --------- | ----- | -------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- | -------- |

6. Choose the Experiment 2 implementation shape.

   Prefer the smallest buildable TermSurf-owned path. Do not bias the result
   toward a fresh throttle merely because it sounds cleaner. Electron's proven
   shape is closer to a narrow patch/fork of the Chrome path, so the audit must
   let the GN dependency evidence decide whether A, B, C, or a hybrid is the
   right first implementation.

   The selected design must specify:
   - new file names, likely under `content/libtermsurf_chromium/`;
   - exact existing files to edit;
   - exact class/function names being added or changed;
   - exact BUILD.gn deps to add;
   - unavoidable `chrome/browser/...` deps that remain, with justification;
   - exact Chromium branch base and branch name;
   - exact existing Issue 776 Experiment 8 patches to keep, modify, or revert;
   - whether the old Issue 776 wrapper throttle remains disabled;
   - whether Experiment 7's PDF extension resource bypass remains intact or is
     replaced by a manifest/resource-policy fix;
   - whether OOPIF PDF is enabled at runtime and how Experiment 2 should log the
     feature flag;
   - what `[issue-789-exp2]` logs should prove at runtime;
   - which missing PDF layer is intentionally deferred after stream handoff.

7. Define build verification before runtime verification.

   Experiment 2 must first prove the dependency surface is narrow. The design
   should require:

   ```bash
   autoninja -C chromium/src/out/Default libtermsurf_chromium
   ```

   The build gate passes only if it links without adding
   `//chrome/browser/plugins:impl` or pulling in the Chrome browser dependency
   graph that caused Issue 776 Experiment 8 to fail.

8. Define the runtime probe for Experiment 2.

   If Experiment 2 builds, the first runtime probe should load the vendored
   Bitcoin PDF with existing automation and inspect logs. The PDF does not need
   to visibly render in Experiment 2.

   Required runtime proof should include logs showing:
   - the TermSurf PDF response throttle saw `application/pdf`;
   - the old wrapper path did not cancel the navigation before the response
     throttle;
   - the original PDF stream was represented as a `StreamContainer` or a
     TermSurf equivalent accepted by `PdfViewerStreamManager`;
   - `PdfViewerStreamManager::AddStreamContainer()` was reached, or the exact
     reason it could not be reached.

   The runtime design should also state that the teardown crash observed in
   Issue 776's automation is residual and out of scope unless it prevents log or
   screenshot capture.

9. Record the design output directly in this experiment.

   The result must include the candidate table from step 5 and a concrete
   Experiment 2 implementation checklist. Each checklist item must name:
   - exact file path;
   - exact class/function being added or modified;
   - owning GN target;
   - expected build invariant or `[issue-789-exp2]` log line proving the item
     works.

10. Format this issue document:

```bash
prettier --write --prose-wrap always --print-width 80 \
  issues/0789-electron-style-pdf-viewer/README.md
```

#### Non-Negotiable Invariants

- Do not modify Chromium source code in Experiment 1.
- Do not modify Rust code in Experiment 1.
- Do not add a Chromium branch in Experiment 1 unless the audit proves a branch
  is needed solely to inspect current state. If a branch is created, do not
  commit code to it.
- Do not design a solution that depends on linking
  `//chrome/browser/plugins:impl` as the primary path.
- Do not design a solution that enables general user extensions.
- Do not weaken PDF renderer or PDF origin security.
- Do not treat "no `chrome/browser` deps" as the goal. Some bounded
  `chrome/browser/...` deps, such as `PdfViewerStreamManager`, may be
  unavoidable. The goal is to avoid broad Chrome product infrastructure and
  document every unavoidable dependency.
- Do not define success as "PDF visibly renders" for Experiment 2. Experiment 2
  success is stream handoff reaching, or precisely failing before,
  `PdfViewerStreamManager`.
- Preserve Issue 776's useful artifacts: internal PDF plugin registration,
  static PDF viewer resource serving, vendored Bitcoin PDF fixture, and
  screenshot automation.

#### Verification

1. Confirm this experiment made documentation-only changes:

   ```bash
   git diff --name-only
   ```

   Expected: only `issues/0789-electron-style-pdf-viewer/README.md` changes
   during Experiment 1 design and result recording.

2. Confirm the Electron audit cites concrete local files, not memory or web
   search.

3. Confirm the Chromium audit cites concrete local files and identifies why
   Issue 776 Experiment 8 pulled in broad Chrome dependencies.

4. Confirm the Chromium audit includes GN evidence, not just `rg` output.

5. Confirm the current Chromium branch / existing patch audit names which Issue
   776 Experiment 8 patches should be kept, modified, or reverted.

6. Confirm the candidate table includes at least A, B, and C, includes pinned
   downstream deps, and gives each candidate a decision with a reason.

7. Confirm the selected Experiment 2 checklist is specific enough to implement
   without another design round.

#### Pass Criteria

Pass if the experiment produces:

- a concrete Electron PDF stream handoff map;
- a concrete Chromium PDF stream handoff map;
- a GN-backed dependency map explaining the `//chrome/browser/plugins:plugins`
  vs. `//chrome/browser/plugins:impl` split;
- a current-branch patch disposition table for the Issue 776 Experiment 8
  residue;
- a candidate comparison table with pinned downstream deps;
- a selected implementation shape for Experiment 2;
- an explicit BUILD.gn dependency plan that avoids the Issue 776 Experiment 8
  dependency explosion;
- a concrete Experiment 2 implementation checklist;
- no code changes.

#### Partial Criteria

Partial if the audit identifies the correct candidate direction but cannot
finish the Experiment 2 checklist because a key Chromium or Electron dependency
relationship is still unknown.

The result must name the exact missing fact and the next command or source file
needed to resolve it.

#### Failure Criteria

- The experiment proposes linking `//chrome/browser/plugins:impl` again without
  a new reason that invalidates Issue 776 Experiment 8's linker result.
- The experiment hand-waves "copy Electron" without naming files, dependencies,
  and patch points.
- The experiment designs a fake PDF renderer or external handoff.
- The experiment ignores current Issue 776 Experiment 8 Chromium patches.
- The experiment uses ripgrep-only dependency reasoning when GN data is
  available.
- The experiment quietly expands Experiment 2 into the full
  MimeHandlerView/GuestView/pdf_viewer_private stack instead of isolating the
  first stream handoff layer.
- The experiment changes code.

**Result:** Pass

Experiment 1 produced the needed design output and made no code changes. The
main finding is that Issue 776 Experiment 8 failed for the reason suspected:
directly linking Chrome's stock plugin response interceptor implementation pulls
Roamium into Chrome's broad browser product dependency graph. Experiment 2
should not retry that path. It should add a TermSurf-owned, PDF-only stream
handoff layer modeled on Electron's patched handoff, with the first build gate
proving that `//chrome/browser/plugins:impl` is not linked.

#### Electron Stream Handoff Map

The local Electron audit shows that Electron does not import Chrome's full
browser feature stack. It installs a narrow handoff path and patches Chromium's
PDF stream code to call Electron-owned glue:

- `vendor/electron/shell/browser/electron_browser_client.cc::CreateURLLoaderThrottles()`
  installs `PluginResponseInterceptorURLLoaderThrottle` for navigation
  responses.
- `vendor/electron/shell/browser/electron_browser_client.cc::WillCreateURLLoaderRequestInterceptors()`
  wires `pdf::PdfURLLoaderRequestInterceptor::MaybeCreateInterceptor(...)` with
  Electron's PDF stream delegate.
- `vendor/electron/shell/browser/electron_browser_client.cc::RegisterBrowserInterfaceBindersForFrame()`
  binds `pdf::mojom::PdfHost` through `pdf::PDFDocumentHelper`. This is needed
  after stream handoff and is out of scope for Experiment 2.
- `vendor/electron/shell/renderer/renderer_client_base.cc::RenderFrameCreated()`
  binds `extensions::mojom::MimeHandlerViewContainerManager` in renderer frames.
- `vendor/electron/shell/renderer/renderer_client_base.cc::IsPluginHandledExternally()`
  calls `MimeHandlerViewContainerManager::CreateFrameContainer(...)` for
  externally handled PDF plugin loads.
- `vendor/electron/shell/browser/extensions/api/streams_private/streams_private_api.cc`
  implements the narrow `SendExecuteMimeTypeHandlerEvent(...)` behavior that
  stores an `extensions::StreamContainer`. For OOPIF PDF, it creates
  `PdfViewerStreamManager` for the `WebContents` and calls
  `AddStreamContainer(frame_tree_node_id, internal_id, stream_container)`.
- `vendor/electron/shell/browser/plugins/plugin_utils.cc` is paired with the
  interceptor redirect. Electron does not use Chrome's full plugin-utils
  implementation for this handoff.
- `vendor/electron/patches/chromium/hack_plugin_response_interceptor_to_point_to_electron.patch`
  redirects Chrome's plugin response interceptor includes from Chrome
  `streams_private` and `plugin_utils` to Electron equivalents.

The Electron model to copy is not "link Chrome." It is "patch or fork the Chrome
handoff point so it calls embedder-owned stream glue."

#### Chromium Stream Handoff Map

The Chromium path starts in
`chrome/browser/plugins/plugin_response_interceptor_url_loader_throttle.cc`.
That throttle observes plugin-eligible responses, creates a viewer/template
response through `MimeHandlerViewAttachHelper::CreateTemplateMimeHandlerPage()`,
wraps the original response in a `blink::mojom::TransferrableURLLoader`, and
dispatches the original stream to
`extensions::mime_handlers::SendExecuteMimeTypeHandlerEvent(...)`.

The dispatch path in
`chrome/browser/extensions/api/mime_handlers/dispatch_mime_handler_event.cc`
creates an `extensions::StreamContainer`. In the OOPIF PDF case, it uses
`chrome/browser/pdf/pdf_viewer_stream_manager.cc` to store that stream until the
PDF viewer frame claims it.

The GN audit is the important part:

- `//chrome/browser/plugins:plugins` is mostly headers and modest public
  dependencies: `content/public/browser`, `content/public/common`, profile,
  prefs, content-settings common, infobars core, network mojom, blink common,
  and build flags.
- `//chrome/browser/plugins:impl` owns
  `plugin_response_interceptor_url_loader_throttle.cc` and `plugin_utils.cc`.
  Its direct dependencies include `//chrome/browser:browser_process`,
  `//chrome/browser:browser_public_dependencies`, `//chrome/browser/extensions`,
  `//components/guest_view/browser`, `//chrome/browser/infobars`,
  `//components/component_updater`, `//components/metrics_services_manager`,
  `//extensions/browser`, and `//extensions/common`.
- The queried `//chrome/browser/pdf:pdf_viewer_stream_manager` target does not
  exist in this checkout. The owning target is `//chrome/browser/pdf:pdf`, which
  includes `pdf_viewer_stream_manager.cc/h` but also brings broad PDF viewer
  resources and Chrome browser PDF support.
- `gn refs ... plugin_response_interceptor_url_loader_throttle.cc` did not
  produce a useful reverse-reference tree for this source file; the actual
  ownership came from `chrome/browser/plugins/BUILD.gn`.

Baseline build on the current Chromium branch `148.0.7778.97-issue-776-exp8`
fails at the final `libtermsurf_chromium.dylib` link. The failure includes:

- `prerender::ChromeNoStatePrefetchContentsDelegate::FromWebContents(...)`
  referenced from Chrome's `dispatch_mime_handler_event.o`;
- macOS ScreenCaptureKit symbols from Chrome WebRTC capture code:
  `SCShareableContent`, `SCStreamConfiguration`, `SCScreenshotManager`, and
  `SCContentFilter`;
- `AVCaptureDevice` from Chrome media permission code.

That confirms the direct-link path pulls unrelated Chrome product infrastructure
into Roamium.

Patch disposition for Experiment 2:

| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `chrome/browser/plugins/plugin_response_interceptor_url_loader_throttle.*`   | Revert                         | This modifies the stock Chrome interceptor but still leaves ownership in `//chrome/browser/plugins:impl`, which is the failed dependency.     |
| `chrome/browser/extensions/api/mime_handlers/dispatch_mime_handler_event.cc` | Revert                         | This patches Chrome's stock dispatch path and links broad Chrome extension infrastructure. TermSurf needs its own stream-dispatch helper.     |
| `chrome/browser/pdf/pdf_viewer_stream_manager.cc`                            | Revert/log later               | Experiment 8 logging is useful diagnostically but should not be a permanent upstream Chrome patch for the first TermSurf-owned handoff.       |
| `content/libtermsurf_chromium/BUILD.gn`                                      | Modify                         | Remove `//chrome/browser/plugins:impl`; add only the narrow deps required by TermSurf-owned files.                                            |
| `content/libtermsurf_chromium/ts_browser_client.cc/h`                        | Modify                         | Keep the idea of installing a PDF response throttle, but install a TermSurf-owned throttle instead of Chrome's stock interceptor class.       |
| `content/libtermsurf_chromium/ts_pdf_navigation_throttle.cc`                 | Keep disabled wrapper behavior | The old data-wrapper cancellation path is disabled on Exp 8. Experiment 2 should preserve that: PDF navigation must reach the response layer. |

The clean branch base for Experiment 2 should be `148.0.7778.97-issue-776-exp7`,
then create `148.0.7778.97-issue-789-exp2`. If Experiment 2 branches from Exp 8
instead, its first step must explicitly revert the failed direct-link patches

| B. Patch stock interceptor to call TermSurf shims           | Patch Chrome interceptor includes like Electron; add TermSurf `streams_private` and plugin-utils shims      | Still needs the owning target for the stock `.cc`, unless the target is split                                                                                                                           | Same as A                                                                                                                            | Risk remains high because stock `.cc` lives in `//chrome/browser/plugins:impl`; patching includes alone does not remove target-level deps | Would keep/reshape stock interceptor patches, but only after a GN target split | Not Experiment 2 unless paired with a target split.

The selected shape is a hybrid of A and C: create a TermSurf-owned PDF-only
response throttle by copying the relevant Chrome response-interceptor logic into
`content/libtermsurf_chromium/`, then strip it until it has no dependency on
Chrome plugin utilities, real `ExtensionRegistry`, or
`//chrome/browser/plugins:impl`.

#### Experiment 2 Implementation Checklist

Branch:

1. Start from `148.0.7778.97-issue-776-exp7`.
2. Create `148.0.7778.97-issue-789-exp2`.
3. Add the branch to `chromium/README.md`.

Code shape:

1. Add `content/libtermsurf_chromium/ts_pdf_response_interceptor.h`.
   - Owning target: `content/libtermsurf_chromium`.
   - Class/function: a PDF-only URL loader throttle class modeled on Chrome's
     `PluginResponseInterceptorURLLoaderThrottle`.
   - Build invariant: no dependency on `//chrome/browser/plugins:impl`.
   - Runtime log: `[issue-789-exp2] pdf-response-throttle-created`.
2. Add `content/libtermsurf_chromium/ts_pdf_response_interceptor.cc`.
   - Detect `application/pdf` with the post-sniff MIME value.
   - Create or call the viewer-template response path needed by the PDF viewer.
   - Transfer the original response body through a
     `blink::mojom::TransferrableURLLoader`.
   - Runtime log:
     `[issue-789-exp2] pdf-response url=... mime=... destination=... oopif_pdf=...`.
3. Add `content/libtermsurf_chromium/ts_pdf_stream_dispatch.h/cc`.
   - Implement only the PDF part of Electron's
     `SendExecuteMimeTypeHandlerEvent(...)`.
   - Construct the `extensions::StreamContainer` or the narrow equivalent
     accepted by `PdfViewerStreamManager`.
   - Call `PdfViewerStreamManager::Create(web_contents)` and
     `AddStreamContainer(frame_tree_node_id, internal_id, stream_container)`, if
     the bounded dependency can link.
   - Runtime logs: `[issue-789-exp2] stream-dispatch ...` and
     `[issue-789-exp2] stream-container-added ...`.
4. Edit `content/libtermsurf_chromium/ts_browser_client.cc/h`.
   - Install the TermSurf throttle in `CreateURLLoaderThrottles()`.
   - Do not include or instantiate Chrome's
     `PluginResponseInterceptorURLLoaderThrottle`.
   - Runtime log: `[issue-789-exp2] pdf-throttle-installed`.
5. Edit `content/libtermsurf_chromium/BUILD.gn`.
   - Add the new TermSurf files.
   - Do not add `//chrome/browser/plugins:impl`.
   - Add only narrow deps required by the new code. Any `chrome/browser/...` dep
     must be documented in the experiment result.
6. Preserve `content/libtermsurf_chromium/ts_pdf_navigation_throttle.cc` with
   the wrapper-cancel path disabled.
   - Runtime proof: old wrapper logs show the navigation proceeds to the
     response throttle.
7. Preserve Issue 776 Experiment 7 static PDF viewer resource serving.
   - Do not fix the manifest/resource policy in Experiment 2 unless the stream
     handoff reaches `PdfViewerStreamManager` and then fails only on resource
     policy.
8. Log `chrome_pdf::features::IsOopifPdfEnabled()` in the response path.
   - If false, mark Experiment 2 Partial and design the next experiment around
     enabling the PDF process model.

Build verification for Experiment 2:

```bash
export PATH="$PWD/chromium/depot_tools:$PATH"
autoninja -C chromium/src/out/Default libtermsurf_chromium
gn desc chromium/src/out/Default //content/libtermsurf_chromium deps
```

The build passes only if `libtermsurf_chromium` links and the dependency output
does not include `//chrome/browser/plugins:impl`,
`//components/guest_view/browser`, Chrome WebRTC capture, or Chrome media
permission subsystems as a consequence of the PDF handoff.

Runtime verification for Experiment 2:

1. Run the existing Issue 776 Bitcoin PDF automation.
2. Inspect logs for:
   - `[issue-789-exp2] pdf-throttle-installed`;
   - `[issue-789-exp2] pdf-response ... mime=application/pdf`;
   - evidence the old wrapper path did not cancel the navigation;
   - `[issue-789-exp2] stream-dispatch ...`;
   - `[issue-789-exp2] stream-container-added ...`, or a precise failure before
     that line.
3. Visible PDF rendering is not required for Experiment 2. The expected pass is
   that the original PDF stream reaches, or precisely fails immediately before,
   `PdfViewerStreamManager`.
4. The teardown crash from Issue 776 remains out of scope unless it prevents log
   or screenshot capture.

#### Conclusion

Experiment 1 confirms the next step should not be another direct link to
Chrome's plugin implementation. Electron's useful lesson is the ownership
boundary: keep the PDF stream handoff in embedder-owned code, and let that code
feed Chromium's PDF stream manager.

Experiment 2 should implement the TermSurf-owned PDF response throttle and
stream-dispatch helper on a fresh Chromium branch from the last buildable PDF
branch. Its first success condition is build shape, not visible rendering.

### Experiment 2: Build a TermSurf PDF Stream Handoff

#### Description

Implement the first Electron-style PDF stream handoff layer in TermSurf-owned
Chromium code.

This experiment replaces the failed Issue 776 Experiment 8 direct dependency on
Chrome's `//chrome/browser/plugins:impl` with a narrow PDF-only URL loader
throttle under `content/libtermsurf_chromium/`. The new path should observe PDF
responses, preserve the original PDF response body as a transferable stream, and
emit the PDF viewer embedder/template HTML response that Chromium's PDF viewer
path expects.

This is still not a visible-rendering experiment. A Pass means the code builds
without Chrome's broad plugin implementation, sees a PDF response, emits the
viewer-template payload, and proves the original PDF stream has been captured in
the first TermSurf handoff layer. Reaching
`PdfViewerStreamManager::AddStreamContainer()` is a stretch outcome, not the
Pass bar, because in this Chromium checkout `PdfViewerStreamManager` is owned by
the broad `//chrome/browser/pdf:pdf` target. Splitting, forking, or replacing
that manager is a later experiment unless a narrow link path appears during
implementation.

Visible PDF rendering, MimeHandlerView renderer wiring, `pdf_viewer_private`,
`PdfHost`, full viewer behavior, and the final stream-manager integration remain
follow-up layers unless this experiment happens to reach them naturally without
breaking the build/dependency gate.

#### Changes

1. Create a new Chromium branch from the last buildable PDF branch.

   ```bash
   cd chromium/src
   git checkout 148.0.7778.97-issue-776-exp7
   git checkout -b 148.0.7778.97-issue-789-exp2
   ```

   Update `chromium/README.md` in the main repo to list the new branch and link
   it to this issue.

   Do not branch from `148.0.7778.97-issue-776-exp8` unless the first commit on
   the new branch explicitly reverts the failed direct-link path from that
   branch.

2. Preserve useful Issue 776 work.

   Keep these layers from the latest buildable PDF branch:
   - internal PDF plugin registration;
   - static PDF viewer resource serving from Issue 776 Experiment 7;
   - vendored Bitcoin PDF fixture and screenshot automation;
   - disabled old data-wrapper cancellation behavior, if present on the chosen
     base.

   If the chosen base branch still has the old data-wrapper cancellation active,
   disable it before installing the new response handoff. Preferred mechanism:
   remove the old PDF navigation throttle from
   `TsBrowserClient::CreateThrottlesForNavigation()`. Acceptable fallback: leave
   the throttle installed only if its PDF branch always returns `PROCEED` and
   logs that it did so.

   PDF navigation must not be canceled after the new URL loader throttle swaps
   in the viewer-template response. The old navigation throttle can still see
   `application/pdf` after the body swap, so "disabled" must mean no cancel path
   remains.

3. Add a TermSurf-owned PDF response URL loader throttle.

   Add:

   ```text
   chromium/src/content/libtermsurf_chromium/ts_pdf_response_url_loader_throttle.h
   chromium/src/content/libtermsurf_chromium/ts_pdf_response_url_loader_throttle.cc
   ```

   The implementation should be modeled on Chromium's
   `PluginResponseInterceptorURLLoaderThrottle`, but stripped to the PDF-only
   path.

   Requirements:
   - derive from the Chromium URL loader throttle interface used by
     `ContentBrowserClient::CreateURLLoaderThrottles()`;
   - inspect the post-sniff response MIME type;
   - handle only `application/pdf`;
   - log `destination=` on every PDF entry and initially handle only the request
     destinations required for the top-level Bitcoin PDF automation;
   - leave all non-PDF responses untouched;
   - do not call `PluginUtils::GetExtensionIdForMimeType()`;
   - do not require `ExtensionRegistry` lookup for the first pass;
   - hard-code only the PDF viewer extension identity needed for the stream
     handoff, with a comment explaining that this is the PDF-only equivalent of
     Electron's embedder-owned plugin-utils path;
   - inline or copy the PDF embedder/template HTML equivalent of Chromium's
     `IDR_PDF_EMBEDDER_HTML` into TermSurf-owned code, with a comment pointing
     to the upstream resource it tracks;
   - do not call
     `extensions::MimeHandlerViewAttachHelper::CreateTemplateMimeHandlerPage()`
     in this experiment unless GN proves that doing so does not pull broad
     extension/browser dependencies;
   - log:

     ```text
     [issue-789-exp2] pdf-response-throttle-created
     [issue-789-exp2] pdf-response url=<url> mime=<mime> destination=<destination> oopif_pdf=<true|false>
     [issue-789-exp2] viewer-template-emitted internal_id=<id> bytes=<n>
     ```

   The response URL loader throttle must not include
   `chrome/browser/plugins/plugin_response_interceptor_url_loader_throttle.h` or
   instantiate Chrome's stock `PluginResponseInterceptorURLLoaderThrottle`.

4. Add a TermSurf-owned PDF stream dispatch helper.

   Add:

   ```text
   chromium/src/content/libtermsurf_chromium/ts_pdf_stream_dispatch.h
   chromium/src/content/libtermsurf_chromium/ts_pdf_stream_dispatch.cc
   ```

   This helper should implement only the PDF-specific subset of Electron's
   `SendExecuteMimeTypeHandlerEvent(...)`.

   Requirements:
   - receive the original PDF response as a
     `blink::mojom::TransferrableURLLoader`;
   - construct `extensions::StreamContainer` from the narrow
     `//extensions/browser/mime_handler:stream_container` target;
   - do not substitute a TermSurf stand-in type for `StreamContainer`;
   - attempt `PdfViewerStreamManager::Create(web_contents)` and
     `PdfViewerStreamManager::AddStreamContainer(frame_tree_node_id, internal_id, stream_container)`
     only if GN and link evidence show the owning PDF target does not recreate
     the broad dependency failure;
   - log:

     ```text
     [issue-789-exp2] stream-dispatch frame_tree_node_id=<id> extension_id=<id> handler_url=<url> internal_id=<id>
     [issue-789-exp2] stream-container-added internal_id=<id>
     ```

   If linking `PdfViewerStreamManager` requires `//chrome/browser/pdf:pdf`, stop
   before adding that dependency unless a GN/link check proves it is safe. A
   buildable throttle plus `StreamContainer` capture, followed by a precise "PDF
   stream manager is too broad" result, is still a valid Pass for this
   experiment. The next experiment should then choose between splitting
   `//chrome/browser/pdf:pdf`, forking the stream manager, or accepting a
   carefully bounded Chrome PDF dependency.

5. Install the TermSurf response URL loader throttle.

   Edit:

   ```text
   chromium/src/content/libtermsurf_chromium/ts_browser_client.h
   chromium/src/content/libtermsurf_chromium/ts_browser_client.cc
   ```

   In `TsBrowserClient::CreateURLLoaderThrottles()`, append the TermSurf PDF
   response URL loader throttle after preserving the existing
   shell/content-shell throttles.

   Log:

   ```text
   [issue-789-exp2] pdf-throttle-installed frame_tree_node_id=<id> destination=<destination>
   ```

   Do not install the stock Chrome interceptor.

6. Update `content/libtermsurf_chromium/BUILD.gn`.

   Add the new TermSurf files and the narrow deps needed by those files.

   Required dependency rule:
   - do not add `//chrome/browser/plugins:impl`;
   - do not add `//chrome/browser/extensions:extensions` merely to reuse
     Chrome's stock MIME dispatch;
   - do not pull in `//components/guest_view/browser`,
     `//chrome/browser/infobars`, Chrome WebRTC capture, or Chrome media
     permission subsystems as a side effect of this handoff.

   Bounded dependencies are acceptable only if the experiment result documents
   why they are unavoidable for the PDF stream handoff. Likely candidates
   include:
   - `//extensions/browser/mime_handler:stream_container`;
   - `//extensions/browser/mime_handler:stream_info`;
   - the narrowest available PDF stream-manager target, if one exists.

   Before adding any target that was only assumed to exist, confirm target names
   with:

   ```bash
   gn ls chromium/src/out/Default //extensions/browser/mime_handler:*
   gn ls chromium/src/out/Default //chrome/browser/pdf:*
   ```

   The current expectation from Experiment 1 is that
   `//extensions/browser/mime_handler:stream_container` exists and is narrow,
   while the only PDF stream-manager owner is broad `//chrome/browser/pdf:pdf`.
   Do not add `//chrome/browser/pdf:pdf` in this experiment unless GN and link
   evidence disprove that expectation.

7. Add temporary runtime diagnostics only under the `[issue-789-exp2]` prefix.

   It is acceptable to add temporary logs to the new TermSurf-owned files. Avoid
   adding permanent diagnostic noise to stock Chrome files. If a stock Chrome
   file must be logged to pinpoint the handoff boundary, keep the log minimal
   and record it in the result as cleanup debt.

   Required feature log:

   ```text
   [issue-789-exp2] oopif-pdf-enabled value=<true|false>
   ```

   If OOPIF PDF is false, stop treating stream handoff as a Pass. Mark the
   experiment Partial and design the next experiment around enabling the PDF
   process/model path.

8. Commit the Chromium branch and archive patches only after the build result is
   coherent.

   If the Chromium code builds, commit the Chromium branch with git-poet and
   regenerate the patch archive:

   ```bash
   cd chromium/src
   git format-patch 148.0.7778.97-issue-776-exp7..HEAD \
     -o ../../chromium/patches/issue-789/
   ```

   If the implementation reaches a useful Partial but does not build because of
   a precisely identified dependency boundary, commit only if the branch is a
   coherent artifact for the next experiment. Otherwise, leave the code
   uncommitted, record the failure, and revert before closing the experiment
   result in the main repo.

9. Format any touched C++ files with Chromium's formatter.

   Use Chromium's normal formatting tooling for modified C++/header files. Do
   not run `cargo fmt`; this experiment should not edit Rust.

10. Format this issue document after recording the result:

```bash
prettier --write --prose-wrap always --print-width 80 \
  issues/0789-electron-style-pdf-viewer/README.md
```

#### Non-Negotiable Invariants

- Do not link `//chrome/browser/plugins:impl`.
- Do not instantiate Chrome's stock `PluginResponseInterceptorURLLoaderThrottle`
  from TermSurf code.
- Do not enable general user extensions.
- Do not add a general Chrome `streams_private` API surface. Implement only the
  PDF stream handoff needed by the viewer path.
- Do not weaken PDF origin checks, bypass `IsPdfRenderer()` checks, or mark an
  ordinary renderer as a PDF renderer.
- Do not fake rendering by replacing PDFs with static HTML, screenshots,
  external apps, or Preview handoff.
- Do not make visible PDF rendering the Pass condition for this experiment.
- Do not change the TermSurf protobuf protocol.
- Do not edit Rust code.
- Preserve existing non-PDF navigation behavior.
- Preserve normal HTML browsing.
- Preserve the Issue 776 Bitcoin PDF automation fixture.

#### Verification

1. Confirm the Chromium branch starts from the intended base:

   ```bash
   git -C chromium/src branch --show-current
   git -C chromium/src merge-base --is-ancestor \
     148.0.7778.97-issue-776-exp7 HEAD
   ```

   Expected branch: `148.0.7778.97-issue-789-exp2`.

2. Confirm the failed direct-link path is not present:

   ```bash
   rg "//chrome/browser/plugins:impl|PluginResponseInterceptorURLLoaderThrottle" \
     chromium/src/content/libtermsurf_chromium \
     chromium/src/chrome/browser/plugins
   ```

   Expected:
   - no `//chrome/browser/plugins:impl` in
     `content/libtermsurf_chromium/BUILD.gn`;
   - no TermSurf include or instantiation of Chrome's stock
     `PluginResponseInterceptorURLLoaderThrottle`;
   - stock Chrome files unchanged unless the result explicitly records a minimal
     patch.

3. Inspect the TermSurf GN dependency surface:

   ```bash
   export PATH="$PWD/chromium/depot_tools:$PATH"
   gn args chromium/src/out/Default --list >/dev/null
   gn ls chromium/src/out/Default //extensions/browser/mime_handler:*
   gn ls chromium/src/out/Default //chrome/browser/pdf:*
   gn desc chromium/src/out/Default //content/libtermsurf_chromium deps
   ```

   Record whether the output includes any of:
   - `//chrome/browser/plugins:impl`;
   - `//chrome/browser/extensions:extensions`;
   - `//components/guest_view/browser`;
   - Chrome WebRTC capture targets;
   - Chrome media permission targets.

   Any such dependency is a failure unless the result proves it is unrelated to
   the PDF changes and already existed on the base branch.

4. Build Chromium:

   ```bash
   cd chromium/src
   export PATH="$HOME/dev/termsurf/chromium/depot_tools:$PATH"
   autoninja -C out/Default libtermsurf_chromium
   ```

   This is the primary gate. The build must link `libtermsurf_chromium.dylib`
   without the Issue 776 Experiment 8 undefined symbols.

5. If the build passes, run the existing Issue 776 Bitcoin PDF automation.

   Use the vendored fixture, not the network URL. Capture the same screenshot
   and logs as Issue 776, but evaluate only the stream-handoff logs for this
   experiment. The Issue 776 teardown crash remains residual and out of scope
   unless it prevents log or screenshot capture.

6. Confirm the runtime logs include:

   ```text
   [issue-789-exp2] pdf-throttle-installed
   [issue-789-exp2] oopif-pdf-enabled value=<true|false>
   [issue-789-exp2] pdf-response ... mime=application/pdf
   [issue-789-exp2] viewer-template-emitted ...
   [issue-789-exp2] stream-dispatch ...
   ```

   If `oopif-pdf-enabled` is `false`, stop here and record Partial with reason
   `OOPIF PDF disabled`.

   If the handoff reaches `PdfViewerStreamManager`, also require:

   ```text
   [issue-789-exp2] stream-container-added ...
   ```

   If the handoff fails before that line, the result must quote the last
   `[issue-789-exp2]` line and identify the exact missing dependency or API.

   Also verify the old data-wrapper navigation throttle did not cancel the
   navigation after the response body was swapped. The expected proof is
   `[issue-789-exp2] pdf-response ...` with no later wrapper-cancel log for the
   same PDF navigation.

   If the embedder template navigates to the PDF viewer extension URL, verify
   the existing Issue 776 Experiment 7 resource path served it, for example with
   an `[issue-776-exp7] served ... pdf/index.html ...` log line.

7. Confirm ordinary browsing still works:
   - open a normal HTML page;
   - click a link;
   - type in a text field;
   - reload.

   These checks ensure the new response throttle leaves non-PDF responses alone.

8. Confirm a non-PDF binary response is not intercepted.

   Load a small non-PDF fixture if one exists, or add a tiny local binary
   fixture under the existing test server assets if needed. The logs should not
   show `pdf-response ... mime=application/pdf` for that response.

9. Record the result in this experiment.

   The result must include:
   - Chromium branch name;
   - commit hash if a Chromium commit was made;
   - patch archive path if generated;
   - exact new files;
   - exact GN deps added;
   - target-name evidence from `gn ls`;
   - build result;
   - dependency-surface result;
   - runtime log summary;
   - whether `PdfViewerStreamManager::AddStreamContainer()` was reached;
   - what layer remains for Experiment 3.

#### Pass Criteria

Pass if:

- the Chromium branch builds and links `libtermsurf_chromium`;
- `content/libtermsurf_chromium` does not depend on
  `//chrome/browser/plugins:impl`;
- the TermSurf-owned PDF response URL loader throttle is installed;
- PDF responses reach the TermSurf-owned response URL loader throttle;
- the response path emits the PDF viewer-template payload from TermSurf-owned
  code;
- the original PDF stream is captured as an `extensions::StreamContainer`, or
  the result proves that the next missing boundary is exactly the broad
  `PdfViewerStreamManager` owner target;
- normal HTML browsing still works;
- non-PDF binary responses are not handled as PDFs;
- all changes are committed to a Chromium branch and archived in
  `chromium/patches/issue-789/`;
- the main repo records the result and branch metadata.

#### Partial Criteria

Partial if the implementation avoids `//chrome/browser/plugins:impl` and builds
partway, but a narrower downstream PDF layer proves missing or too broad. Valid
Partial outcomes include:

- the response URL loader throttle builds, sees `application/pdf`, and creates
  the transferable loader, but cannot yet construct
  `extensions::StreamContainer`;
- `extensions::StreamContainer` cannot be constructed without importing a larger
  extension subsystem than expected;
- OOPIF PDF is disabled at runtime;
- the response path cannot emit the viewer-template payload without importing
  broad `MimeHandlerViewAttachHelper` dependencies;
- the stream reaches `PdfViewerStreamManager`, but the viewer frame cannot claim
  it because the MimeHandlerView renderer/container layer is still missing.

The result must name the exact boundary and the next experiment must target only
that boundary.

#### Failure Criteria

- The implementation adds `//chrome/browser/plugins:impl`.
- The implementation reuses Chrome's stock
  `PluginResponseInterceptorURLLoaderThrottle` by linking its owning target.
- The implementation silently imports Chrome's broad extension/browser stack.
- The implementation weakens PDF security checks to get past renderer or origin
  gates.
- The implementation reintroduces the data-wrapper fake PDF path as the primary
  solution.
- The implementation claims success because a screenshot looks different while
  the stream handoff logs are missing.
- Normal HTML browsing regresses.
- Non-PDF responses are intercepted as PDFs.
- The Chromium branch is left in an incoherent, unbuildable state without a
  recorded Partial/Failure explanation and cleanup plan.

**Result:** Pass

Experiment 2 built the first TermSurf-owned PDF stream handoff layer and avoided
the failed Issue 776 Experiment 8 dependency path.

#### What Changed

`TsBrowserClient::CreateURLLoaderThrottles()` now installs a TermSurf-owned PDF
URL loader throttle. The old data-wrapper `TsPdfNavigationThrottle` cancel path
is disabled by no longer registering that throttle from
`CreateThrottlesForNavigation()`.

The new `TsPdfResponseURLLoaderThrottle`:

- observes post-sniff `application/pdf` responses;
- logs request destination and OOPIF PDF state;
- emits a TermSurf-owned copy of Chromium's PDF embedder/template HTML;
- intercepts the response body;
- preserves the original PDF body as a `blink::mojom::TransferrableURLLoader`;
- dispatches that original stream to `TsDispatchPdfStream()`.

The new `TsDispatchPdfStream()` constructs and stores an
`extensions::StreamContainer` from the narrow
`//extensions/browser/mime_handler:stream_container` target. It deliberately
does not link `PdfViewerStreamManager`, because the only current owner is broad
`//chrome/browser/pdf:pdf`.

#### Dependency Evidence

Target-name checks:

```text
//extensions/browser/mime_handler:stream_container
//extensions/browser/mime_handler:stream_info

//chrome/browser/pdf:pdf
//chrome/browser/pdf:pdf_extension_test_utils
//chrome/browser/pdf:pdf_pref_names
//chrome/browser/pdf:pdf_test_utils
```

The TermSurf dependency surface includes:

```text
//extensions/browser/mime_handler:stream_container
```

It does not include:

```text
//chrome/browser/plugins:impl
//chrome/browser/extensions:extensions
//components/guest_view/browser
```

The expected warning about `enable_nacl = false` having no effect appeared in GN
output and is unrelated to this experiment.

#### Build Verification

Build command:

```bash
cd chromium/src
export PATH="$HOME/dev/termsurf/chromium/depot_tools:$PATH"
autoninja -C out/Default libtermsurf_chromium
```

Result:

```text

```

The previous Issue 776 Experiment 8 undefined symbols did not recur.

#### Runtime Verification

PDF run:

```text
logs/issue-789-exp2-20260527-180734/
```

The run used debug Wezboard, debug `web`, and the repo-built Roamium binary:

```

The old wrapper cancel log did not appear for the PDF navigation.

Normal HTML smoke:

```text
logs/issue-789-exp2-html-20260527-180811/
```

This run installed the throttle but emitted no `pdf-response` or
`stream-dispatch` lines.

Non-PDF binary smoke:

```text
logs/issue-789-exp2-bin-20260527-180823/
```

This run installed the throttle but emitted no `pdf-response` or
`stream-dispatch` lines. The existing content-shell download-path log appeared,
which confirms the binary response was not handled as a PDF.

The known Issue 776 teardown crash recurred after screenshot/log capture. It did
not prevent the experiment evidence from being collected.

#### Conclusion

Experiment 2 succeeded at the intended build-first layer. TermSurf now has a
buildable, TermSurf-owned PDF response throttle that avoids
`//chrome/browser/plugins:impl`, emits the PDF viewer-template response, and
captures the original PDF response as an `extensions::StreamContainer`.

The remaining blocker is the final stream-manager integration. In Chromium 148,
`PdfViewerStreamManager` is still owned by broad `//chrome/browser/pdf:pdf`.
Experiment 3 should decide how to provide that layer without recreating the
Issue 776 Experiment 8 dependency explosion: split the upstream target, fork the
stream manager into TermSurf-owned code, or prove that a carefully bounded
Chrome PDF dependency can link safely.

### Experiment 3: Resolve Captured PDF Streams

#### Description

Connect the Experiment 2 captured PDF stream to the lookup path used by
Chromium's PDF viewer.

Experiment 2 proved that TermSurf can intercept an `application/pdf` response,
emit the PDF viewer template payload, preserve the original PDF body as a
`blink::mojom::TransferrableURLLoader`, and store it as an
`extensions::StreamContainer`. The remaining gap is ownership: Chromium's normal
OOPIF PDF path stores and resolves these streams through
`PdfViewerStreamManager`, but in this checkout that implementation is owned by
the broad `//chrome/browser/pdf:pdf` target.

This experiment should add the narrowest TermSurf-owned stream manager layer
that can resolve the `internal_id` emitted by the viewer-template response and
return the captured stream to the PDF viewer path. The primary Pass criterion is
not "PDF visibly renders" yet. A Pass means the viewer-side stream request
reaches TermSurf's stream manager and successfully claims the captured
`StreamContainer` without importing the failed broad Chrome dependency set from
Issue 776 Experiment 8.

Visible PDF rendering is a stretch outcome. If it happens, record it. If it does
not, the result must name the next missing layer after successful stream
resolution.

#### Changes

1. Create a new Chromium branch from Experiment 2.

   ```bash
   cd chromium/src
   git checkout 148.0.7778.97-issue-789-exp2
   git checkout -b 148.0.7778.97-issue-789-exp3
   ```

   Update `chromium/README.md` in the main repo to list the new branch.

2. Audit Chromium's stream-manager call sites before changing code.

   Run:

   ```bash
   cd chromium/src
   rg "PdfViewerStreamManager|GetStreamContainer|AddStreamContainer|StreamContainer" \
     chrome/browser/pdf \
     chrome/browser/extensions \
     extensions/browser \
     components/pdf \
     pdf \
     content/libtermsurf_chromium
   gn desc out/Default //chrome/browser/pdf:pdf deps
   gn desc out/Default //extensions/browser/mime_handler:stream_container deps
   ```

   Record in the experiment result:
   - which function the PDF viewer uses to claim a stream by `internal_id`;
   - whether that claim path is browser-side, renderer-side, or extension API
     driven;
   - which smallest source files are required for lookup/claim;
   - whether any of those files require `//chrome/browser/pdf:pdf`,
     `//chrome/browser/plugins:impl`, `//chrome/browser/extensions:extensions`,
     `//components/guest_view/browser`, Chrome media permission code, Chrome
     WebRTC capture code, or prerender browser delegates.

3. Choose one narrow stream-manager strategy.

   Use this order:
   1. **Split upstream target if clean.** If `PdfViewerStreamManager` and its
      direct helpers can be moved into a smaller GN target without dragging
      unrelated Chrome browser infrastructure, create a target such as:

      ```text
      //chrome/browser/pdf:pdf_viewer_stream_manager
      ```

      Then depend on that target from `content/libtermsurf_chromium`.

   2. **Fork the manager into TermSurf-owned code.** If the upstream file is
      small but its owning target is too broad, copy only the required stream
      manager behavior into:

      ```text
      content/libtermsurf_chromium/ts_pdf_stream_manager.h
      content/libtermsurf_chromium/ts_pdf_stream_manager.cc
      ```

      The fork should manage only:
      - storing an `extensions::StreamContainer` by `internal_id`;
      - claiming/removing that stream by `internal_id`;
      - lifecycle cleanup when the owning `WebContents` goes away.

      It must not copy unrelated Chrome PDF viewer UI, preferences, metrics,
      download, permission, or extension registry behavior.

   3. **Prove a bounded Chrome dependency.** Only use `//chrome/browser/pdf:pdf`
      if `gn desc` and a successful link prove it does not reintroduce the Issue
      776 Experiment 8 dependency explosion. This is expected to fail and should
      not be the first implementation choice.

   If none of the three choices can build cleanly, mark the experiment Partial
   and record the smallest unbuildable dependency boundary.

4. Replace the Experiment 2 static map with the chosen stream manager.

   Update:

   ```text
   content/libtermsurf_chromium/ts_pdf_stream_dispatch.cc
   content/libtermsurf_chromium/ts_pdf_stream_dispatch.h
   ```

   so `TsDispatchPdfStream(...)` stores the captured `StreamContainer` in the
   chosen stream manager rather than a standalone static map.

   Required logs:

   ```text
   [issue-789-exp3] stream-manager-created ...
   [issue-789-exp3] stream-container-added internal_id=<id> ...
   ```

   Preserve the Experiment 2 logs long enough to compare old and new behavior.

5. Wire the viewer-side claim path to TermSurf's stream manager.

   The exact file depends on the audit in step 2. The implementation must be
   driven by the actual `internal_id` lookup path, not by another guessed
   wrapper or navigation redirect.

   Acceptable outcomes:
   - the existing PDF viewer request path can call the new TermSurf manager;
   - a narrow copied/forked lookup helper can call the new TermSurf manager;
   - a bounded Chromium target split exposes the existing manager without broad
     Chrome infrastructure.

   Required logs:

   ```text
   [issue-789-exp3] stream-container-claim-request internal_id=<id> ...
   [issue-789-exp3] stream-container-claimed internal_id=<id> ...
   ```

   If the viewer never asks for the stream, do not synthesize success. Record
   which layer failed to issue the claim.

6. Keep the dependency gate strict.

   `content/libtermsurf_chromium` must not add:

   ```text
   //chrome/browser/plugins:impl
   //chrome/browser/extensions:extensions
   //components/guest_view/browser
   ```

   It also must not pull in the unresolved Issue 776 Experiment 8 link failures:
   - `ChromeNoStatePrefetchContentsDelegate`;
   - macOS ScreenCaptureKit symbols from Chrome WebRTC capture;
   - Chrome media permission symbols.

   Any new `chrome/browser/...` dependency must be listed in the result with its
   reason and `gn desc` evidence.

7. Preserve non-PDF behavior.

   Do not modify:
   - Wezboard;
   - Roamium Rust code;
   - `webtui`;
   - `termsurf.proto`;
   - the old data-wrapper navigation path except to keep it disabled;
   - normal HTML navigation;
   - non-PDF binary download behavior.

8. Format and archive.

   Run Chromium formatting on modified C++/GN files:

   ```bash
   cd chromium/src
   ../depot_tools/clang-format -i <modified .cc/.h files>
   export PATH="$HOME/dev/termsurf/chromium/depot_tools:$PATH"
   gn format content/libtermsurf_chromium/BUILD.gn
   ```

   Build before committing the Chromium branch. After the branch commit,
   regenerate the patch archive:

   ```bash
   rm -rf ../../chromium/patches/issue-789
   git format-patch 148.0.7778.97-issue-776-exp7..HEAD \
     -o ../../chromium/patches/issue-789/
   ```

   The archive should include Experiment 2 and Experiment 3 commits as the
   current Issue 789 patch stack.

#### Verification

1. Build `libtermsurf_chromium`.

   ```bash
   cd chromium/src
   export PATH="$HOME/dev/termsurf/chromium/depot_tools:$PATH"
   autoninja -C out/Default libtermsurf_chromium
   ```

   Pass requires a clean link. A build that reaches compile but fails at the
   final dylib link with the Issue 776 Experiment 8 symbol set is a Failure, not
   a Partial, unless the result identifies a smaller target split that would
   remove those symbols.

2. Inspect the dependency surface.

   ```bash
   gn desc out/Default //content/libtermsurf_chromium deps
   rg "//chrome/browser/plugins:impl|//chrome/browser/extensions:extensions|//components/guest_view/browser" \
     content/libtermsurf_chromium chrome/browser/pdf chrome/browser/plugins
   ```

   The forbidden targets must not appear as TermSurf dependencies.

3. Run the existing automated Bitcoin PDF smoke test.

   ```bash
   LOG_DIR="$PWD/logs/issue-789-exp3-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)" \
   TERMSURF_PDF_SETTLE_SECONDS=8 \
   ./scripts/test-issue-776-pdf.sh http://localhost:9616/bitcoin.pdf
   ```

   Required log sequence:

   ```text
   [issue-789-exp2] pdf-response ...
   [issue-789-exp2] viewer-template-emitted internal_id=<id> ...
   [issue-789-exp3] stream-manager-created ...
   [issue-789-exp3] stream-container-added internal_id=<same id> ...
   [issue-789-exp3] stream-container-claim-request internal_id=<same id> ...
   [issue-789-exp3] stream-container-claimed internal_id=<same id> ...
   ```

   The exact `internal_id` must match from template emission through claim.

4. Capture screenshot output.

   The screenshot does not define Pass for this experiment, but it should be
   archived with the logs. Classify the visual result as one of:
   - PDF visibly rendered;
   - viewer shell loaded but PDF body not displayed;
   - blank/white surface;
   - download/error page;
   - renderer crash;
   - automation failure.

   If PDF visibly renders, mark that as a stretch success and record whether
   scrolling the first page works.

5. Run normal HTML smoke.

   ```bash
   LOG_DIR="$PWD/logs/issue-789-exp3-html-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)" \
   TERMSURF_PDF_SETTLE_SECONDS=4 \
   ./scripts/test-issue-776-pdf.sh http://localhost:9616/index.html
   ```

   The PDF response and stream-manager logs must not appear.

6. Run non-PDF binary smoke.

   ```bash
   LOG_DIR="$PWD/logs/issue-789-exp3-bin-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)" \
   TERMSURF_PDF_SETTLE_SECONDS=4 \
   ./scripts/test-issue-776-pdf.sh http://localhost:9616/test.bin
   ```

   The PDF response and stream-manager logs must not appear. Existing download
   behavior is acceptable.

7. Record the known teardown crash separately.

   The Issue 776 teardown crash is still out of scope unless it prevents logs or
   screenshots from being captured. If it recurs after evidence collection, note
   it but do not treat it as an Experiment 3 failure.

#### Pass Criteria

- `libtermsurf_chromium` builds and links.
- The implementation avoids the forbidden broad Chrome dependency set.
- The PDF response reaches the Experiment 2 response throttle.
- The emitted viewer-template `internal_id` is stored in the Experiment 3 stream
  manager.
- The viewer-side claim path requests the same `internal_id`.
- The stream manager returns the captured `StreamContainer` for that
  `internal_id`.
- Normal HTML and non-PDF binary smoke tests do not trigger PDF stream-manager
  behavior.
- The patch archive is regenerated under `chromium/patches/issue-789/`.

#### Partial Criteria

Partial if the implementation builds and stores streams in the new manager, but
one downstream layer still prevents a successful claim. Valid Partial outcomes
include:

- the viewer never requests the `internal_id`;
- the viewer requests a different `internal_id`;
- the request path is gated by a missing extension API or PDF viewer private
  API;
- the stream is claimed but the viewer still cannot render because `PdfHost`,
  PDF process routing, or viewer-private bindings are missing;
- the upstream manager can be split cleanly but requires a separate Chromium
  target refactor to keep the experiment reviewable.

The result must name the next exact missing layer and include the relevant logs.

#### Failure Criteria

- The implementation imports `//chrome/browser/plugins:impl`.
- The implementation imports broad Chrome extension/browser or guest-view
  infrastructure to make the stream lookup work.
- The build reproduces the Issue 776 Experiment 8 final-link failures without a
  smaller target-split explanation.
- The implementation weakens PDF origin, process, or renderer checks to force a
  claim.
- The implementation reintroduces the data-wrapper fake PDF path as the primary
  solution.
- The implementation claims Pass from screenshot differences without a matching
  `stream-container-claimed` log.
- The PDF `internal_id` does not match from template emission through stream
  claim.
- Normal HTML or non-PDF binary behavior regresses.
