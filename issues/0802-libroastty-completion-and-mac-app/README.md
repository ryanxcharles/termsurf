# Issue 802: Complete libroastty and prove it with a copied, renamed Ghostty macOS app

## Goal

Finish reimplementing `libghostty` (Zig) as `libroastty` (Rust), and **prove the
port is correct** by running a **copied, lightly-renamed** version of Ghostty's
macOS app on top of `libroastty` — fully, automatically tested. The end state: a
complete Zig→Rust reimplementation of `libroastty`, and a `ghostty`→`roastty`
find/replaced (otherwise **unaltered**) macOS app that runs, supports all
features, and is verified feature-by-feature against the real app's behavior via
automated UI testing (macOS automation APIs + screenshots).

The unaltered-except-for-rename app is the point: if Ghostty's own app runs
correctly on `libroastty`, the port is correct end to end. The app is the
**conformance test**.

## Background

**Predecessor:**
[Issue 801 — Reimplement libghostty as libroastty](../0801-roastty-libghostty-rewrite/README.md).
This issue continues directly from it.

**Vendored Ghostty pin (upstream version under test):** every `vendor/ghostty/…`
reference and ABI target in this issue is against **Ghostty commit
`2c62d182cec246764ff725096a70b9ef44996f7f`** (branch `main`; `git describe`:
`tip-1608-g2c62d182c`; dated 2026-05-29; `build.zig.zon`
`version = "1.3.2-dev"`; requires zig `0.15.2`). The copied app and the embedded
ABI must match this commit.

[Issue 801](../0801-roastty-libghostty-rewrite/README.md) ported the large
majority of `libghostty` to `libroastty` (terminal core largely complete; the
renderer's data + Metal/**offscreen** pipeline fully composed and driven from
`(terminal, config)`; font/text, input-encoding, and configuration foundations;
a growing `roastty_*` C ABI) under a 4394-test suite. It closed with two facts
that define this issue:

1. **The remaining subsystems are partial**, not started-from-scratch — they
   need an audit and completion in dependency order (see 801's
   [Subsystem checklist](../0801-roastty-libghostty-rewrite/README.md#subsystem-checklist)
   and [Conclusion](../0801-roastty-libghostty-rewrite/README.md#conclusion)).
2. **roastty's current C ABI diverges from libghostty's app-facing ("embedded")
   ABI.** libghostty exposes ~71 coarse `ghostty_*` exports — an `app` object, a
   `surface` object with `surface_draw` (the _library_ renders into an
   app-provided `NSView`), and a `ghostty_runtime_config_s` **callback/action**
   struct the app supplies (`set_title`, clipboard, bell, …). roastty instead
   exposes ~239 granular exports shaped around a `roastty_render_state_*` _pull_
   model (the _app_ draws) plus fine-grained terminal accessors. That
   render-state path is interim scaffolding; libghostty's embedded ABI is the
   faithful target.

**The strategic decision (this issue):** rather than write a new macOS app,
**copy Ghostty's** and rename it. This (a) gives a precise, externally-defined
ABI target (`apprt/embedded.zig` + `ghostty.h`) with no design ambiguity, (b)
turns the app into a conformance test, (c) provides the test host that the
renderer's live `surface_draw` path needs (the app supplies the `NSView`), and
(d) defers any Rust rewrite of the app — the renamed Swift app works as the
oracle, and a Rust rewrite can come later as its own issue if desired (the
project may yet want it for consistency, but it must not block this work).

## Scope

Three workstreams, in rough dependency order.

### 1. Audit the architecture and finish the port (Zig → Rust)

- **Audit** the completed `libghostty` architecture (the vendored
  `vendor/ghostty/src`) against `libroastty`, and decide which subsystems still
  need reimplementation. Produce a concrete, prioritized checklist (faithful /
  partial / missing), building on 801's Subsystem checklist.
- **Reimplement the remaining subsystems in a logical, dependency-driven
  order**, Zig → Rust, gated experiment by experiment. Known remaining work from
  801:
  - **The embedded app-runtime ABI** (`apprt/embedded.zig` / `ghostty.h`) — the
    single largest item: the `ghostty_app` object model + tick/event
    integration, `ghostty_surface_draw` rendering into the app-provided `NSView`
    (the live render wiring deferred in 801), the `ghostty_runtime_config_s`
    callback struct, and the action dispatch surface — with **byte-faithful**
    struct layouts, enums, and semantics. This supersedes the interim
    `roastty_render_state_*` path.
  - **Config** finalize/validation/diagnostics and the full upstream field set.
  - **Input** — the keybinding system (`Binding` / action dispatch) and keymaps.
  - **Font & text** — `SharedGridSet`, `opentype/` / embedded font tables.
  - **Terminal core** — `tmux` control mode; render/render-state parity items.
  - **Renderer** — remaining `state` / `image` / `pipeline` / main-loop items.

### 2. Copy (not translate) the Ghostty macOS app and rename it

- **Copy** Ghostty's macOS app into the roastty project **as-is** (pin a
  specific Ghostty version; the app and the ABI must match the same version).
- **Find/replace `ghostty` → `roastty`** (and `Ghostty` → `Roastty`,
  `GhosttyKit` → `RoasttyKit`, bundle identifiers, the linked library + header,
  etc.) and make any other strictly-mechanical `ghostty→roastty` changes
  required to build and link against `libroastty`.
- **Otherwise leave it unaltered.** No feature rewrites, no logic changes — the
  whole value is that an unmodified app is a true conformance test. Make it
  **build, run, and support all features** against `libroastty`; every gap is a
  bug in the port (workstream 1) to fix, not a reason to edit the app.

### 3. Automatically test the macOS app end to end

- **Automate** the app under macOS UI-automation APIs (e.g. XCUITest /
  Accessibility / `osascript` / `screencapture`), driving real interactions.
- **Take screenshots** and verify the app _looks right_ (golden/visual checks
  where appropriate).
- **Exercise every feature** in the UI on top of `libroastty` — typing,
  rendering, selection, clipboard, scrollback, search, splits/tabs, config, key
  bindings, resize, color schemes, etc. — and confirm each actually works.
- **Anything that doesn't work gets fixed** — in `libroastty` (the port), since
  the app is unaltered.

## Architecture / Analysis

- **The embedded ABI is the contract.**
  `vendor/ghostty/src/apprt/embedded.zig` + the generated `ghostty.h` define
  exactly what the app calls and what callbacks it provides. Matching this is
  unambiguous: match upstream, version-pinned. The faithful `roastty.h` must be
  a structural rename of `ghostty.h` (identical struct
  layouts/enums/signatures).
- **Conformance, not translation.** Because the app is copied unaltered (only
  renamed), a passing app _is_ the proof of a faithful port. This is a far
  stronger oracle than unit tests, and it makes the automated UI tests
  (workstream 3) the acceptance criteria for the whole reimplementation.
- **Layering of verification:** unit/integration tests (library), offscreen
  golden-image render tests (no app needed), then live app + automated UI tests
  (the app as host). The three reinforce each other.
- **Risks to confirm early:** (a) that the Ghostty app is a _pure_ embedded-ABI
  consumer (nothing reaches past the C ABI); (b) ABI struct-layout/alignment
  fidelity across the FFI boundary; (c) the macOS UI-automation tooling can
  drive and screenshot the app headlessly/CI-ably; (d) version pinning so the
  app and ABI never skew.

## Screenshots policy

**Screenshots are never committed to this repo.** Verification in this issue is
screenshot-heavy (the app as a visual conformance oracle), so the standing rule
is:

- The capture harness writes screenshots **outside the working tree** by default
  — `${TERMSURF_SHOT_DIR:-$HOME/.cache/termsurf/shots}`.
- As a safety net, a `__screenshots__/` directory name is **git-ignored**
  anywhere in the repo, so an explicit in-repo path still cannot be committed.
- We do **not** commit "golden" reference images. Visual checks are **live A/B**
  — capture the real Ghostty app and the roastty app in the **same run** under
  identical input, diff them, and record only the **verdict / diff metric**. Any
  retained reference lives outside the repo. (The diff metric and tolerance are
  defined by the later A/B-diff experiment; the pinned Ghostty version,
  1.3.2-dev `2c62d18`, substitutes for a committed historical baseline.)

Established in [Experiment 4](04-window-screenshot-capture.md); it supersedes
the earlier "commit a small baseline PNG set" wording in Exp 2.

## Operating notes & lessons learned

- **Verify ABI work with the FULL `cargo test -p roastty`, never just `--lib`.**
  `--lib` skips `tests/abi_harness.rs`, the integration test that compiles
  `abi_harness.c` against `roastty.h` and links the cdylib. Exp 8–15 were
  validated with `--lib` only, so the harness silently failed to compile from
  Exp 8 onward (141 errors) — not caught until Exp 16. The harness is the C-side
  ABI conformance oracle; keep it compiling every experiment.

**Keep this current.** When an experiment yields a durable, reusable fact — a
toolchain incantation, a dead-end to avoid, or where an artifact lives — distill
it here (not only in the experiment file), one line with a pointer. This section
is the **cold-resume cheat-sheet**: if the working context is lost, start here
before re-reading experiments.

### Building & running the real Ghostty app (the conformance host)

- **Build it:** `scripts/ghostty-app/build-macos-app.sh [Debug|ReleaseLocal]` →
  `vendor/ghostty/macos/build/<config>/Ghostty.app`. It runs, shows a working
  terminal. (Exp 3.)
- **Pinned zig 0.15.2** lives at `vendor/toolchains/` (gitignored);
  `setup-zig.sh` fetches it. The vendored ghostty (also gitignored) is pinned at
  commit `2c62d18` (v1.3.2-dev), which requires **exactly** zig 0.15.x.
- The build is **macOS-only by necessity**: zig 0.15.2 can't link this machine's
  **Xcode 26.4 SDK** (`__availability_version_check`), so the lib + Metal are
  built under `DEVELOPER_DIR=CommandLineTools` (the 26.0 SDK links) with Xcode's
  `metal` on `PATH`; the iOS xcframework slice is patched out
  (`macos-only-xcframework.patch`); then `xcodebuild -create-xcframework` +
  `macos/build.nu` build the app under Xcode. (Exp 2/3.)

### Dead-ends — do NOT repeat these

- **Do NOT suggest downgrading Xcode.** ghostty _requires_ Xcode 26 (official
  docs); the machine has 26.4. The gap is the too-new SDK _point release_, not
  the major version. (Exp 2 made this wrong call; Exp 3 corrected it.)
- **Do NOT try to bump the zig version.** `requireZig` enforces an exact
  major.minor and the source targets 0.15.x; even ghostty `main` still pins
  0.15.2 — a higher zig fails to compile `build.zig`. (Exp 3.)
- **Clear the zig caches when switching zig versions**
  (`rm -rf vendor/ghostty/.zig-cache ~/.cache/zig`); mixing 0.16.0 and 0.15.2
  artifacts caused phantom `DarwinSdkNotFound` / missing-archive errors. (Exp
  2/3.)
- **A full-screen `screencapture` grabs the agent's Wezboard Space, not
  Ghostty's** — and a JXA `CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo` call mis-resolves its
  option constant. Capture a specific window by id instead (below). (Exp 3 → 4.)

### Screenshots

- **Capture a window:** `scripts/ghostty-app/screenshot.sh <owner|bundle|pid>` →
  `screencapture -l<id>` via `winid.swift`; Space/occlusion-independent. (Exp
  4.)
- **Never committed** — see the Screenshots policy above; written to
  `$TERMSURF_SHOT_DIR` (default `~/.cache/termsurf/shots`); `__screenshots__/`
  is gitignored.
- **Diff two captures:**
  `swift scripts/roastty-app/pngdiff.swift <expected.png> <actual.png>` emits
  one JSON metrics object on stdout and writes no artifacts (threshold flags:
  `--max-mismatch-ratio`, `--max-mean-channel-delta`). Use it for Phase-D live
  A/B verdicts; keep images outside the repo. (Exp 38.)
- **Run the first live A/B smoke:**
  `scripts/roastty-app/live-ab-smoke.sh --max-mismatch-ratio 1 --max-mean-channel-delta 255`
  launches debug Ghostty + Roastty, drives the same ASCII marker, captures
  Ghostty by window id, captures Roastty through the IOSurface-safe full-screen
  crop path, diffs the captures, prints one JSON summary, and traps exact
  launched-PID-tree cleanup. Strict thresholds currently fail with a useful
  metric rather than parity. (Exp 39.)
- **Choose a live A/B recipe:**
  `scripts/roastty-app/live-ab-smoke.sh --list-recipes`, then
  `scripts/roastty-app/live-ab-smoke.sh --recipe ascii-grid --max-mismatch-ratio 1 --max-mean-channel-delta 255`.
  The JSON summary includes `recipe`; `smoke` remains the default for Exp-39
  compatibility. (Exp 40.)
- **Color live A/B recipe:**
  `scripts/roastty-app/live-ab-smoke.sh --recipe color-grid --max-mismatch-ratio 1 --max-mean-channel-delta 255`
  prints deterministic ANSI palette, background, bold/bright, and truecolor
  rows. Strict thresholds currently fail with recorded metrics, as expected.
  (Exp 41.)
- **Clear-screen live A/B recipe:**
  `scripts/roastty-app/live-ab-smoke.sh --recipe clear-after --max-mismatch-ratio 1 --max-mean-channel-delta 255`
  prints pre-clear rows, emits `3J,H,2J`, then captures fixed post-clear rows.
  Strict thresholds currently fail with recorded metrics, as expected. (Exp 42.)
- **Alt-screen live A/B recipe:**
  `scripts/roastty-app/live-ab-smoke.sh --recipe alt-screen --max-mismatch-ratio 1 --max-mean-channel-delta 255`
  enters alternate screen mode, draws fixed cursor-addressed text, and captures
  while the alt screen is active. Strict thresholds currently fail with recorded
  metrics, as expected. (Exp 43.)

### Input injection (Exp 5)

- **Drive the app:** keyboard via `osascript` System Events, mouse via
  `scripts/ghostty-app/inject.swift` (CGEvent); `byteprobe.py` is the raw-mode
  PTY byte-log oracle. **activate-first** + a **warmup keystroke** (the first
  key after activate drops); never truncate the byte log while the probe holds
  it open; bootstrap to `bash` (default shell is nushell).
- **What fails** (don't re-debug — known): **F11** (macOS-swallowed),
  **Ctrl-K/Ctrl-L** (app-consumed before PTY), **dead-key/IME compose**,
  **synthetic double-click word-select**. Everything else works — including
  **scroll** and full SGR mouse reporting.

### Process hygiene — kill what you spawn

- **End every experiment by killing everything you launched** (debug Ghostty,
  byte probe, background builds): `scripts/ghostty-app/stop-app.sh`. Leave
  nothing dangling.
- **`kill -9 <pid>` scoped to the build path — never `osascript … to quit`**
  (graceful quit pops an "are you sure?" dialog needing the user; SIGKILL can't
  be caught → no dialog). **Never** broad `pkill ghostty` / `killall` — only the
  exact `vendor/ghostty/macos/build/…` PID, so nothing you didn't spawn is
  touched.

### ABI / RoasttyKit (Exp 6)

- **The link artifact:** `scripts/roastty-app/build-roastty-kit.sh` → builds
  `libroastty.a` + assembles `roastty/macos/RoasttyKit.xcframework`
  (gitignored), a structural drop-in for GhosttyKit (module `RoasttyKit`,
  umbrella `roastty.h`).
- **The link surface spans 3 export modules** — `apprt/embedded.zig` +
  `config/CApi.zig`
  - `main_c.zig`; derive the worklist from what the app **calls**
    (`grep -roE 'ghostty_[a-z0-9_]+' macos/Sources`), not one file.
- **The gap is small: 78/84 app-called functions present; 6 missing**
  (`app_key`, `app_keyboard_changed`, `cli_try_action`, `inspector_metal_init`,
  `inspector_metal_render`, `set_window_background_blur`).
- **`roastty.h` is hand-written → name-presence ≠ ABI-presence.** Diff
  signatures + by-value struct layouts. Verified faithful: `surface_config_s`,
  `runtime_config_s` (callback table). **Divergent (the real work):** the **key
  event** — roastty uses an opaque `roastty_key_event_t` handle, but the app
  passes a **by-value `input_key_s` struct**; that embedded by-value ABI must be
  added (`surface_key`/`app_key`/…).
- **Rust `staticlib` native deps** (for the app link):
  `-framework AppKit QuartzCore Metal IOSurface Foundation CoreText CoreGraphics CoreFoundation -lobjc -liconv -lSystem -lc -lm`.
- **The real ABI gap is the TYPE surface, not functions (Exp 7).**
  `scripts/roastty-app/rename-app.sh` copies+renames the app into
  `roastty/macos/` (build via `build.nu`; build/ + RoasttyKit.xcframework
  gitignored). Building it revealed **56 missing `roastty_*` symbols** —
  dominated by **~36 `action_*` payload types/enums** (the `action_s`
  tagged-union members the app reads directly) + input enums + config types. The
  Exp-6 function-signature audit missed these (nested in the union); to scope
  the embedded ABI, diff **all `roastty_*` idents the app references**
  (`grep -rhoE 'roastty_[a-z0-9_]+' roastty/macos/Sources`) vs `roastty.h`.
- **Embedded-ABI implementation pattern (Exp 8):** roastty's internals already
  match upstream value-for-value, so each tranche is mostly (a) expose the
  enums/structs in `roastty.h` byte-faithful (rename existing enums to ghostty's
  exact member names — e.g. `KEY_A`/`DIGIT_0` — values unchanged; alias when an
  equivalent enum exists), (b) thin by-value `#[repr(C)]` + `extern "C"` entries
  that build the internal type and call the existing path, (c) **the real cost:
  migrate roastty's tests off the interim opaque/handle API** (rename the old
  export to `*_handle`, sed the test call sites). Add a `size_of`/`offset_of`
  layout test per struct. `cargo build` only checks the lib — run
  `cargo test --lib` to compile+check the migrated tests.
- **Typed-union ABI without test churn (Exp 9):** when a struct switches from an
  opaque carrier (`int tag; uintptr_t storage[8]`) to a typed tagged union, do
  the `storage→union` conversion at the ONE C-callback boundary (the binding
  path is type-erased, so per-site rewrites are impossible anyway), and add a
  **test-only reverse `union→storage`** so existing `storage[N]` assertions
  round-trip the real conversion untouched. Reuse existing roastty enum type
  names in union members (a blind `ghostty_→roastty_` import re-emits
  enumerators → C redefinition). Pin layout with BOTH Rust `offset_of!` and C
  `_Static_assert` so a Rust↔header drift fails at compile time. `ssize_t` needs
  `#include <sys/types.h>`.

### Where things live

- Harness + recipes: `scripts/ghostty-app/` (`build-macos-app.sh`,
  `setup-zig.sh`, `screenshot.sh`, `winid.swift`,
  `macos-only-xcframework.patch`, `README.md`).
- The architecture gap-list + finish order: [Exp 1](01-architecture-audit.md) +
  the Roadmap below.

## Roadmap

The ordered plan to 100%, derived from
[Experiment 1's audit](01-architecture-audit.md) (whose own phase lettering
predates inserting Phase A — this Roadmap is the authority). Phases run roughly
in order (later phases depend on earlier ones); the strategy front-loads a
**running, automatable app** — the real Ghostty in Phase A (baseline + reusable
harness) and the roastty-backed app drawing by Phase C — so the rest is finished
behind the running conformance oracle. This checklist is the big-picture
progress tracker — check each item off as it lands; the `## Experiments` index
below is the fine-grained record. (A subsystem is "done" only when it works in
the live app, verified by a Phase-D UI test.)

**Phase 0 — Audit**

- [x] Architecture audit: what's done / partial / missing + the order (Exp 1)

**Phase A — Baseline & feasibility: build/run/automate the real Ghostty app**

- [x] Resolve the zig toolchain (pinned **0.15.2** under `vendor/toolchains/`;
      compiles ghostty's zig under `DEVELOPER_DIR=CommandLineTools`)
- [x] Resolve the SDK blocker (Exp 2 → Exp 3): zig 0.15.2 can't link Xcode
      26.4's SDK, so build the **macOS-only** `GhosttyKit` under the
      CommandLineTools 26.0 SDK + a build-only iOS-slice patch — **no Xcode
      change, app unaltered**.
- [x] Build the real, unmodified Ghostty macOS app from `vendor/ghostty/macos`
      (`scripts/ghostty-app/build-macos-app.sh` → `BUILD SUCCEEDED`)
- [x] Launch it; confirm a working terminal window (user-confirmed in Exp 3)
- [x] Screenshot the window **in isolation** (Exp 4: `screencapture -l` +
      `winid.swift`; cross-Space, live pixels, written outside the repo)
- [x] Drive it programmatically (**input injection** — Exp 5: full
      keyboard+mouse matrix mapped; scroll works, 4 known failures) — keyboard
      via `osascript`, mouse via `inject.swift`, byte-log/pasteboard/screenshot
      oracles
- [x] Live-A/B compare (real app vs roastty app, same run) — replaces committed
      "golden" images per the Screenshots policy; deferred to the diff
      experiment (Phase B+)

**Phase B — App shell + ABI link**

- [x] Pin the Ghostty version (app + ABI must match — 1.3.2-dev, `2c62d18`)
- [x] **Record the exact missing/mismatched ABI symbol worklist** (Exp 6): 78/84
      app-called fns present; 6 missing (`app_key`, `app_keyboard_changed`,
      `cli_try_action`, `inspector_metal_init`, `inspector_metal_render`,
      `set_window_background_blur`); `surface_config_s`/`runtime_config_s`
      layouts match; **key-event ABI diverges** (opaque handle vs by-value
      `input_key_s`)
- [x] Build `RoasttyKit.xcframework` — the link artifact (Exp 6)
- [x] Copy + rename the macOS app into `roastty/macos/`; point at
      `RoasttyKit.xcframework`; first build reaches Swift compile (Exp 7,
      `scripts/roastty-app/rename-app.sh`)
- [x] **Make it compile/link — the embedded ABI type surface (Exp 8-13): DONE.**
      The renamed Roastty app **compiles + links** against `libroastty`
      (`** BUILD SUCCEEDED **`); the entire embedded ABI is byte-faithful.
      Original notes: Exp 8 (input) + Exp 9 (action: 36 types + typed `action_u`
      union) + Exp 10 (config/fn tail + mouse/action/init ABI fixes) done —
      **all 56 missing symbols resolved**, 4396 tests green. The app build now
      reaches **past every missing-symbol + enum + init issue** and is blocked
      on the **`selection_s`/`point_s` layout divergence** (Exp-6 #3 → Exp 11).
      The build exposed the real gap = **56 missing `roastty_*` symbols**,
      dominated by the **~36 `action_*` payload types/enums** (the `action_s`
      tagged-union members) + 6 input types/enums + 4 config types + 6 functions
      — plus the `selection_s`/`point_s` subsystem divergence. Implement
      byte-faithful in `libroastty`/`roastty.h`, drive the app's error list to
      zero. (Spans several gated experiments.)

**Phase C — Live render path (the crux)**

- [ ] `surface_draw` owns a Metal renderer bound to the app `NSView`/`CALayer`;
      attach the layer and present on-screen
- [ ] Render thread (frame pacing + cursor-blink timer)
- [ ] Renderer mailbox / `Options` (focus / visible / occlusion / change-config)
- [ ] Retire the interim `render_state` pull divergence
- [ ] **Milestone: the app launches and shows a working ASCII terminal**

**Phase D — Automated UI tests for the roastty-backed app**

- [x] Point the Phase-A harness at the renamed roastty-backed app
- [ ] Golden-diff its screenshots/behavior against the Phase-A real-Ghostty
      baseline
- [ ] Repeatable in-session run, wired so every later phase is regression-tested
      (headless/CI automation is a separate, later concern — see Exp 2's caveat)

**Phase E — Terminal correctness**

- [ ] Port `unicode/` tables (grapheme-break, codepoint-width, symbol/Nerd-Font
      width)
- [ ] Rewrite `Terminal::print()` (width lookup + grapheme accumulation;
      mode 2027)

**Phase F — Config completeness**

- [ ] The remaining ~140 config options (font, palette, link, command,
      cursor/mouse, scrollback, `macos-*`, …)
- [ ] `finalize()` — cross-field validation / derivation / clamping
- [ ] Theme loading (themes-dir locator + file read + palette/option
      application)
- [ ] Conditional state wiring (`changeConditionalState` + conditional reload)
- [ ] `font-codepoint-map` + `clipboard-codepoint-map` as config fields
- [ ] `SharedGridSet` config→font assembly (`Key`/`DerivedConfig` → discovery →
      populated `Collection`), replacing the hardcoded-"Menlo" test path

**Phase G — Input / keybindings**

- [ ] Multi-key sequences / chords (the trie), leader keys, key tables
- [ ] Trigger-prefix flags (`global:` / `all:` / `unconsumed:` / `performable:`)
- [ ] The full action set + the default-bindings data table + reverse
      action→trigger mapping
- [ ] Command-palette catalog (`command.zig`)
- [ ] Native keymaps (`keycodes`, `KeymapDarwin`) + `RemapSet`/`Mask` — if the
      app expects roastty-side translation

**Phase H — Renderer feature-completion (in the live pass)**

- [ ] Invoke image draws (Kitty graphics + background image) in the live draw
      pass
- [ ] Custom-shader screen pass (ping-pong target + post-process apply)
- [ ] Link-highlight matcher (`renderer/link.zig` `renderCellMap`) + feed
      `link_ranges`
- [ ] Debug `Overlay` (optional)

**Phase I — Polish / remaining**

- [ ] Shell-integration injection (`termio/shell_integration.zig`)
- [ ] Sprite legacy-computing coverage (Smooth Mosaics U+1FB3C–1FBEF) + branch
      glyphs (U+F5D0–F5E3)
- [ ] Sentry crash capture (the init/capture half of `crash/`)
- [ ] SIMD fast paths (perf — base64 / VT / index-of / width)
- [ ] `os/cf_release_thread` (perf), terminfo resource

**Workstream 3 (continuous — the harness from Phase A, the roastty app from
Phase D):** every app feature gets an automated UI test — typing, rendering,
selection, clipboard, scrollback, search, splits/tabs, config, key bindings,
resize, color schemes, … — and anything broken is fixed in `libroastty` (the app
stays unaltered except for the rename).

## Experiments

- [Experiment 1: Architecture audit — what's done, what remains, and the order to finish](01-architecture-audit.md)
  — **Pass** · Claude (7 parallel subsystem audits)
- [Experiment 2: Baseline & feasibility — build, run, and automate the real Ghostty app](02-ghostty-app-baseline.md)
  — **Partial** (toolchain blocker found: zig 0.15.2 ↔ Xcode 26.4 SDK +
  iOS-slice; resolved by Exp 3's macOS-only build) · Claude/Claude
- [Experiment 3: macOS-only build — the real Ghostty app builds and runs on this machine](03-macos-only-build.md)
  — **Pass** (macOS-only `GhosttyKit` under CommandLineTools + build-only
  iOS-slice patch; app builds via Xcode 26.4 and runs — no Xcode change) ·
  Claude
- [Experiment 4: Window-isolated screenshot capture (+ no-screenshots-in-repo policy)](04-window-screenshot-capture.md)
  — **Pass** (`screencapture -l<id>` + `winid.swift` captures the Ghostty window
  cross-Space, 1600×1264 px, outside the repo; ScreenCaptureKit fallback
  unneeded) · Claude/Claude
- [Experiment 5: Comprehensive keyboard & mouse input matrix — drive everything, map what works](05-input-injection-matrix.md)
  — **Pass** (full matrix driven + classified; keyboard ~complete, mouse incl.
  **scroll** works; 4 known failures: F11, Ctrl-K/L, dead-key compose, synthetic
  double-click) · Claude/Claude
- [Experiment 6: Phase B — RoasttyKit.xcframework + the embedded-ABI link worklist](06-roastty-kit-and-abi-worklist.md)
  — **Pass** (RoasttyKit builds; 78/84 app-called fns present, 6 missing;
  configs + callback table layout-match; key event diverges — opaque vs
  by-value) · Claude/Claude
- [Experiment 7: Phase B — copy + rename the Ghostty macOS app; first build against RoasttyKit](07-copy-rename-app.md)
  — **Partial** (renamed app builds to Swift compile, links RoasttyKit; the real
  ABI gap is **56 missing symbols** — ~36 `action_*` payload types +
  input/config types — far larger than Exp 6's function audit) · Claude/Claude
- [Experiment 8: Embedded ABI — the input type surface (tranche 1)](08-embedded-abi-input.md)
  — **Pass** (input enums byte-faithful + by-value
  `input_key_s`/`surface_key`/`app_key`; 4395 tests green; gap 56→48) ·
  Claude/Claude
- [Experiment 9: Embedded ABI — the action-dispatch type surface (tranche 2)](09-embedded-abi-action.md)
  — **Pass** (36 action types + typed `action_u` union byte-faithful, central
  storage→union conversion, readonly swap fixed; 4396 tests green; gap 48→11) ·
  Claude/Claude
- [Experiment 10: Embedded ABI — the config + function tail (tranche 3)](10-embedded-abi-config-tail.md)
  — **Partial** (6 config types + 4 fn stubs + mouse/action/init ABI fixes; all
  11 symbols resolved, 4396 tests green; app build now reaches the
  `selection_s`/`point_s` divergence → Exp 11) · Claude/Claude
- [Experiment 11: Embedded ABI — the selection/point layout divergence (Exp-6 #3)](11-embedded-abi-selection.md)
  — **Pass** (embedded `point_s`/`selection_s`/`point_coord_e` byte-faithful +
  the `(tag,coord)`→pin resolver in `read_text`; 4399 tests green; app compiles
  past selection → `target_s`/`action_tag_e` next) · Claude/Claude
- [Experiment 12: Embedded ABI — the target union + the action-tag completion](12-embedded-abi-target-tags.md)
  — **Pass** (`target_s` `target_u` union + 24 `ROASTTY_ACTION_*` tags
  byte-faithful; 4400 tests green; app build 80→1 errors →
  `config_key_is_binding` by-value next) · Claude/Claude
- [Experiment 13: Embedded ABI — `config_key_is_binding` by-value (the last compile error)](13-embedded-abi-config-key.md)
  — **Pass** (`config_key_is_binding` by-value; **the app COMPILES + LINKS** —
  `** BUILD SUCCEEDED **`, Roastty.app produced, Phase B exit; 4401 tests green)
  · Claude/Claude
- [Experiment 14: Phase C — launch Roastty.app and capture what it renders](14-launch-roastty-app.md)
  — **Pass** (the app **launches cleanly** — no crash/panic — but renders blank;
  root cause: `surface_draw` is a stub, the live NSView present path (801 crux)
  is unwired → Exp 15; spawned app killed, 0 dangling) · Claude/Claude
- [Experiment 15: Phase C — the live present path (the 801 crux), slice 1](15-live-present-path.md)
  — **Partial** (live present path wired + the Metal IOSurface layer ATTACHES to
  the app NSView — window white→black, build -> Some(1600x1136); but no frame
  yet: surface_new doesn't auto-start the shell → Exp 16; 4401 tests green) ·
  Claude/Claude
- [Experiment 16: Phase C — `surface_new` auto-starts the IO (the shell-start divergence)](16-surface-new-autostart.md)
  — **Pass** (`surface_new` auto-starts the IO gated on `platform_tag == MACOS`
  — launched app spawns a live `/bin/zsh`; ALSO restored `abi_harness`, silently
  broken since Exp 8 by `--lib`-only testing: 141 compile errors + the readonly
  assert; full `cargo test` green, 0 shell leaks) · Claude
- [Experiment 17: Phase C — atlas coherence (sample the grid's glyph atlas)](17-atlas-coherence.md)
  — **Partial** (present now samples the grid's rasterized atlas — proven by a
  discriminating GPU-readback test; but live text ALSO needs the
  projection/screen-size uniforms, never wired → Exp 18) · Claude
- [Experiment 18: Phase C — wire the projection/screen-size uniforms (live text)](18-projection-uniforms.md)
  — **Pass** (drives the projection/screen-size uniforms from the surface,
  Retina-correct — the launched app renders the live **shell prompt as text**;
  first real terminal frame from libroastty) · Claude
- [Experiment 19: Phase C — a continuous present driver (live updates)](19-present-driver.md)
  — **Pass** (main-thread ~60fps driver drains tick_termio + presents on dirty —
  the terminal is LIVE: typed `echo TERMSURF_LIVE` + its output render live;
  suite 4403+1 green, idle-efficient, clean shutdown) · Claude
- [Experiment 20: Phase C — conformance smoke test (map the feature landscape)](20-conformance-smoke.md)
  — **Pass** (6 probes via ZDOTDIR drive: scroll / colors+truecolor / alt-screen
  / cursor-addressing / resize all WORK; gaps — `clear` drops post-clear content
  (→Exp 22), CJK+emoji tofu / no font fallback (→Exp 21); selection+scrollback
  deferred) · Claude
- [Experiment 21: Phase C — enable font-fallback discovery (CJK + emoji)](21-font-fallback.md)
  — **Pass** (enabled the resolver's discovery fallback in `build_live_renderer`
  — CJK `日本語` renders + `🎉` in COLOR vs `?` before; 4403+1 green; CJK
  wide-pitch fine-tune a noted follow-up) · Claude
- [Experiment 22: Phase C — diagnose + fix the `clear` gap](22-clear-screen.md)
  — **Pass** (root cause: `\033[3J` erase-scrollback errored `InvalidPoint` with
  no history → aborted the slice → post-clear content dropped; fixed to no-op
  (upstream-faithful) + regression test, 4404 green; live re-probe CONFIRMS
  post-clear content renders) · Claude
- [Experiment 23: Phase C — scrollback navigation (deferred Exp-20 probe)](23-scrollback.md)
  — **Pass** (wheel scrollback works live — fixed 3 bugs: mouse_scroll never
  scrolled the viewport, the reporting-gate used a coarse always-true flag, and
  the render read-path read the active bottom not the viewport
  (`Point::active`→`viewport`); 4405 green + CGEvent scroll driver) · Claude
- [Experiment 24: Phase C — suppress the cursor when scrolled into scrollback](24-cursor-in-scrollback.md)
  — **Pass** (a stray cursor block rendered on scrollback history rows; fixed
  with a pin-based `Terminal::cursor_viewport_position()` feeding both
  cursor-block-draw sites — `None` when scrolled off-viewport, faithful to
  upstream `cursor.viewport`; 4406 green + live-confirmed) · Claude
- [Experiment 25: Phase C — mouse-drag text selection (deferred Exp-20 probe)](25-mouse-selection.md)
  — **Pass** (mouse-drag selection was unwired; wired the `SelectionGesture`
  into the core `mouse_button`/`mouse_pos`, viewport-pin-anchored so it works in
  scrollback; headless 2-case test + 4408 green + live highlight) · Claude
- [Experiment 26: Phase C — clipboard copy of a selection (deferred Exp-20 probe)](26-clipboard-copy.md)
  — **Pass** (copy was already wired + unit-tested; added the missing
  drag-gesture→copy integration test + live proof — drag-select then Edit▸Copy
  lands the text on NSPasteboard, `pbpaste` confirms; 4409 green) · Claude
- [Experiment 27: Phase C — double/triple-click word & line selection](27-word-line-selection.md)
  — **Pass** (Exp-25 passed `time_ns: None` so click-count was stuck at 1/Cell;
  gave the Surface a monotonic clock + an injectable test clock → double-click
  word, triple-click line; 4410 green deterministic + live word/line highlight)
  · Claude
- [Experiment 28: Phase C — drag-selection autoscroll past the edge](28-drag-autoscroll.md)
  — **Pass** (gesture set `autoscroll` but nothing called `autoscroll_tick`;
  wired a tick into the present loop + clamped `selection_drag` past-edge
  positions so a held drag-above-edge scrolls into history + extends; 4411
  green + live 78→55 scroll w/ highlight) · Claude
- [Experiment 29: Phase C — CJK ideographic wide-pitch (`set_point_size`)](29-cjk-wide-pitch.md)
  — **Partial** (wired set_point_size in build_live_renderer so discovered CJK
  faces get the IcWidth ideographic resize; 4411 green + design-review-confirmed
  load-bearing/no-regression; live CJK width comparison pending — screen locked)
  · Claude
- [Experiment 30: Phase C — shift-click extends the selection](30-shift-click-extend.md)
  — **Partial** (shift-click extends the selection from its anchor when >500ms
  since the last press; not-reporting press branches to selection_drag; 2
  headless tests + 4413 green deterministic (also fixed a latent Exp-27
  double_click flaky test); live shift-click pending — screen locked) · Claude
- [Experiment 31: Phase C — viewport-gate the cursor run-shaping hint](31-cursor-hint-viewport.md)
  — **Pass** (Exp-24 loose end: the `shape_run_options` cursor run-shaping hint
  used active `cy==y`, breaking a ligature on a scrolled history row; gated on
  the viewport via `cursor_viewport_row`; 4414 green, fully headless) · Claude
- [Experiment 32: Phase C — widen the reporting-mode selection clear+reset](32-reporting-clear-widen.md)
  — **Pass** (hoisted the reporting-mode selection clear+reset out of the
  Left-only branch → any button + press/release clears while reporting, faithful
  to upstream; 4415 green, fully headless) · Claude
- [Experiment 33: Phase C — shift overrides mouse-reporting for selection](33-shift-while-reporting.md)
  — **Partial** (shift overrides mouse-reporting for selection — shift-drag
  selects in a mouse-mode TUI + suppresses the report (button-gated so bare
  motion still reports); flag-first shiftCapture (config deferred); 4-case
  headless test + 4416 green; live shift-drag pending — screen locked) · Claude
- [Experiment 34: Phase C — plumb the `mouse-shift-capture` config into `shiftCapture`](34-shift-capture-config.md)
  — **Pass** (plumbed `mouse-shift-capture` config (parsed → App →
  `capture_shift`) into the full `mouseShiftCapture` logic;
  Never/Always/flag/default all honored; 4417 green, fully headless — closes
  Exp-33's config sub-deferral) · Claude
- [Experiment 35: Phase C — rebuild the renderer on a DPI (content-scale) change](35-dpi-change-rebuild.md)
  — **Partial** (`set_content_scale` now drops the renderer on a DPI change so
  present_live rebuilds at the new scale — no more stale-DPI blur after a
  monitor move; headless change-detection test + 4418 green; live re-sharpen
  pending — screen locked) · Claude
- [Experiment 36: Phase C — report color-scheme changes live (DECSET 2031)](36-color-scheme-change-report.md)
  — **Pass** (mode 2031 now reports OS theme changes live — `set_color_scheme`
  emits `997;1n`/`997;2n` on a change via the new
  `Terminal::report_color_scheme_change`, gated on 2031, change-only;
  deterministic terminal-level test + 4419 green, fully headless) · Claude
- [Experiment 37: Phase C — in-band size reports (DECSET 2048)](37-in-band-size-reports.md)
  — **Pass** (mode 2048 in-band size reports now emit on enable
  (`set_mode_basic`) + on resize (`set_size`→`report_in_band_size`) — was
  registered+encoded but never emitted; deterministic terminal-level test + 4420
  green, fully headless) · Claude
- [Experiment 38: Phase D — screenshot diff metric for live A/B checks](38-screenshot-diff-metric.md)
  — **Pass** · Codex/Codex/Codex
- [Experiment 39: Phase D — live A/B smoke harness](39-live-ab-smoke-harness.md)

  **Pass**
- [Experiment 42: Phase D — clear-screen live A/B recipe](42-live-ab-clear-recipe.md)
  — **Pass**
- [Experiment 43: Phase D — alt-screen live A/B recipe](43-live-ab-alt-screen-recipe.md)
  — **Pass**
- [Experiment 44: Phase D — scroll-output live A/B recipe](44-live-ab-scroll-output-recipe.md)
  — **Designed**

## Process

Standard project process (see `CLAUDE.md`): one gated experiment at a time —
designed, AI-reviewed before implementation, plan-committed, implemented,
verified (tests / the bounded runner), result-recorded, AI-reviewed before the
next, and result-committed.

**Keep the issue current as you go (part of the result step, not optional).**
After each experiment, besides flipping its status in the index: (1) distill any
durable, reusable fact or dead-end into
[Operating notes & lessons learned](#operating-notes--lessons-learned), and (2)
update the [Roadmap](#roadmap) checkboxes. That lessons section is what makes
this issue survivable across context resets — if a fact would cost time to
rediscover, it belongs there.

**Kill every process you spawned — at the end of each experiment, leave nothing
dangling (mandatory).** Experiments here launch the debug Ghostty app, byte
probes, background builds, etc. When the experiment ends (pass _or_ fail),
terminate all of them so nothing is left running on the user's screen or
machine. Rules:

- **Kill by PID, scoped to what you spawned** — for the app,
  `scripts/ghostty-app/stop-app.sh` (kills the `vendor/ghostty/macos/build/…`
  process by PID). **Never** `osascript … to quit` (it's graceful and pops a
  confirmation dialog needing the user) — use **SIGKILL** (`kill -9 <pid>`),
  which can't be caught, so there is no dialog.
- **Never kill anything you didn't spawn.** No broad `pkill ghostty` /
  `pkill -f Ghostty` / `killall` — scope every match to the exact build-output
  path or the specific PID you launched, so an installed/stable Ghostty or any
  unrelated app is never touched.
- **Prefer launch → drive → stop in one flow** (`start-app.sh` → drive →
  `stop-app.sh`); don't leave the app running across turns "for the next step."

## Closure Criteria

This issue closes when `libroastty` faithfully implements libghostty's embedded
ABI and the remaining subsystems, **and** the copied, `ghostty→roastty`-renamed
macOS app builds, runs, and passes automated UI tests covering all features
against `libroastty` — i.e. a complete Zig→Rust reimplementation, proven by a
lightly modified real app that fully works.
