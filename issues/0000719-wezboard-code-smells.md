# Issue 719: Wezboard code smells from objc2 migration

## Goal

Fix all code smells introduced during the objc2 migration (Issues 715-718). The
migration was mechanically sound but left behind unwrap-on-fallible-init, magic
numbers, redundant CGRect copies, verbose boilerplate, missing safety comments,
dead code, and inconsistent patterns.

## Background

An audit of the full diff from the rename commit (`eeeefdc`) to HEAD identified
13 code smells. None are showstoppers, but several are real risks (panics on
null ObjC init, UB on null `Box::from_raw`, missing safety docs on raw pointer
arithmetic).

## Smells

### 1. `Retained::from_raw(...).unwrap()` on fallible ObjC inits

`Retained::from_raw` returns `Option`. If `alloc` + `init` returns null (OOM,
init failure), `.unwrap()` panics. The OpenGL cases already use `.ok_or_else()`
— the remaining sites should too.

Sites:

| File                            | Line | Object                   |
| ------------------------------- | ---- | ------------------------ |
| `window/src/os/macos/window.rs` | 539  | `NSWindow`               |
| `window/src/os/macos/window.rs` | 3477 | `NSView` (initWithFrame) |
| `window/src/os/macos/app.rs`    | 206  | AppDelegate              |
| `window/src/os/macos/menu.rs`   | 174  | menu wrapper             |

Fix: Replace `.unwrap()` with `.ok_or_else(|| anyhow!("failed to init X"))` and
propagate with `?`, or use `expect("description")` where the function returns
`()` and panic is acceptable.

### 2. Manual ivar pointer arithmetic without safety comments

`get_view_ivar` and `set_view_ivar` in `window.rs:1982-1991` compute ivar
offsets via raw pointer math. The `.unwrap()` on `instance_variable()` will
panic if the ivar name doesn't match. No `// SAFETY:` comments document
invariants.

Fix: Add `// SAFETY:` comments explaining the invariants (ivar exists because we
registered it in `ClassBuilder`, type is `*mut c_void`, object is a valid
instance of the expected class).

### 3. `Weak::load().unwrap()` double unwrap

`window.rs:1882`: `self.view_id.as_ref().unwrap().load().unwrap()` — panics if
the view has been deallocated. The old code had the same risk (null deref
instead of panic), but this should be proper error handling.

Fix: Return `anyhow::Result` and use `context()`.

### 4. Magic numbers for ObjC constants

Bare integer literals with inline comments replace what were previously named
constants from the `cocoa` crate:

| Value      | Meaning                         | File:Line        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `236isize` | `NSOpenGLCPSurfaceOpacity`      | `window.rs:286`  |
| `222isize` | `NSOpenGLCPSwapInterval`        | `window.rs:293`  |
| `2_isize`  | `NSWindowTabbingModeDisallowed` | `window.rs:548`  |
| `1u64`     | `NSWindowMiniaturizeButton`     | `window.rs:1521` |
| `0u64`     | `NSWindowCloseButton`           | `window.rs:1521` |
| `2u64`     | `NSWindowZoomButton`            | `window.rs:1521` |

Fix: Define named constants at the top of the file.

### 5. `Box::from_raw` without null guard in menu dealloc

`menu.rs:317-320`: The `dealloc` callback calls `get_ivar` then
`Box::from_raw(item)` without checking for null. If the ivar is null (e.g., init
failed before setting it), this is instant UB.

Fix: Add a null check before `Box::from_raw`.

### 6. No-op `CGRect` re-wrapping (12 sites)

`CGRect::new(CGPoint::new(frame.origin.x, frame.origin.y), CGSize::new(frame.size.width, frame.size.height))`
copies a `CGRect` into an identical `CGRect`. This exists because the old code
converted between `cocoa::foundation::NSRect` and `CGRect` using a
`cg_to_ns_rect` helper. After the migration both sides are `CGRect`, making the
conversion a no-op.

12 sites in `window.rs`: lines 346, 348, 435, 437, 667, 669, 974, 976, 1129,
2318, 2322, 3475.

Fix: Delete the re-wrapping. Use the `CGRect` directly.

### 7. Verbose `__r` boilerplate pattern (44 sites)

```rust
let __r: *mut AnyObject = objc2::msg_send![...];
__r as id
```

This exists because `msg_send!` infers return type from context, and the `id`
alias doesn't trigger inference. 44 occurrences in `window.rs`.

Fix: Define an inline helper:

```rust
unsafe fn msg_send_id(args...) -> id {
    objc2::msg_send![...]
}
```

Or use a macro. Alternatively, annotate the return type directly where possible:
`let x: id = objc2::msg_send![...] as id;` — though this may not always work
with `msg_send!` inference.

### 8. `std::env::set_var` thread safety

`listener.rs:21`: `std::env::set_var("TERMSURF_SOCKET", &sock_path)` is unsafe
in Rust 2024 edition and not thread-safe. It's called during startup before
other threads read env vars, but this is fragile.

Fix: Use `unsafe { std::env::set_var(...) }` with a `// SAFETY:` comment, or
pass the socket path through a different channel (e.g., store in a global or
pass as an argument to child process spawning).

### 9. `type id = *mut AnyObject` defined in two files

`window.rs:52` and `core_text.rs:6` both define the same type alias. The alias
is used inconsistently — some code uses `id`, some uses `*mut AnyObject`
directly, and new code uses `Retained<AnyObject>`. The coexistence of raw `id`
and owned `Retained<AnyObject>` in the same functions is confusing.

Fix: Keep the alias for now (removing it touches ~100 sites), but ensure
consistency — new code should not mix `id` and `*mut AnyObject` in the same
function.

### 10. Inconsistent `#[allow(deprecated)]` vs manual ivar helpers

`app.rs` and `menu.rs` use `#[allow(deprecated)]` with `get_ivar`/`set_ivar`.
`window.rs` replaced them with manual `get_view_ivar`/`set_view_ivar` pointer
arithmetic. Two different approaches for the same problem.

Fix: Use `#[allow(deprecated)]` with `get_ivar`/`set_ivar` everywhere — it's
simpler and less error-prone than manual pointer arithmetic. Remove
`get_view_ivar`/`set_view_ivar` and use the deprecated API with suppression
instead.

### 11. Dead `TermSurfState`

`state.rs`: Empty struct behind `lazy_static` mutex, never used. Added as
scaffolding in Issue 715 Experiment 5.

Fix: Delete the file and the `mod state` declaration. Re-add when actually
needed.

### 12. Dead `yes_no!` macro

The audit flagged this but grep shows it no longer exists — already cleaned up.
No action needed.

### 13. Missing `// SAFETY:` comments on unsafe blocks

No `unsafe` blocks in the migration have safety comments. This is consistent
with the upstream WezTerm style but is a Rust anti-pattern.

Fix: Add `// SAFETY:` comments to the new unsafe blocks we introduced (ivar
helpers, `Retained::from_raw`, `Box::from_raw`, `msg_send!` blocks that do
non-obvious things). Don't retrofit comments to inherited upstream code.

## Experiments

### Experiment 1: Quick mechanical fixes

#### Goal

Fix smells 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11, 13 — all the changes that are pure cleanup with no
behavior change. Build and run the app to verify nothing breaks.

#### Changes

**Smell 2 — Safety comments on ivar helpers** (`window.rs:1982-1991`)

Add `// SAFETY:` comments to `get_view_ivar` and `set_view_ivar`:

```rust
// SAFETY: The VIEW_CLS_CNAME ivar is registered in the ClassBuilder for
// WezboardWindowView with type *mut c_void. The caller guarantees obj is a
// valid instance of that class.
unsafe fn get_view_ivar(obj: &AnyObject) -> *mut c_void {
```

Same pattern for `set_view_ivar`.

**Smell 4 — Named constants for magic numbers** (`window.rs`)

Add constants near the top of the file (after existing constant definitions):

```rust
const NS_OPENGL_CP_SURFACE_OPACITY: isize = 236;
const NS_OPENGL_CP_SWAP_INTERVAL: isize = 222;
const NS_WINDOW_TABBING_MODE_DISALLOWED: isize = 2;
const NS_WINDOW_CLOSE_BUTTON: u64 = 0;
const NS_WINDOW_MINIATURIZE_BUTTON: u64 = 1;
const NS_WINDOW_ZOOM_BUTTON: u64 = 2;
```

Replace all 6 inline magic numbers with these constants.

**Smell 5 — Null guard on `Box::from_raw`** (`menu.rs:315-324`)

Before:

```rust
extern "C" fn dealloc(this: *mut AnyObject, _sel: Sel) {
    unsafe {
        #[allow(deprecated)]
        let item = (*this).get_ivar::<*mut c_void>(WRAPPER_FIELD_NAME);
        let item = (*item) as *mut RepresentedItem;
        let item = Box::from_raw(item);
        drop(item);
```

After:

```rust
extern "C" fn dealloc(this: *mut AnyObject, _sel: Sel) {
    unsafe {
        #[allow(deprecated)]
        let item = (*this).get_ivar::<*mut c_void>(WRAPPER_FIELD_NAME);
        if !(*item).is_null() {
            let item = (*item) as *mut RepresentedItem;
            drop(Box::from_raw(item));
        }
```

**Smell 6 — Remove no-op CGRect re-wrapping** (`window.rs`, 12 sites)

Every site follows one of two patterns:

Pattern A — intermediate variable that's only used as a msg_send arg:

```rust
// Before:
let frame: CGRect = objc2::msg_send![..., frame];
let frame_cg = CGRect::new(CGPoint::new(frame.origin.x, ...), ...);
let backing_cg: CGRect = objc2::msg_send![..., convertRectToBacking: frame_cg];
let backing_frame = CGRect::new(CGPoint::new(backing_cg.origin.x, ...), ...);

// After:
let frame: CGRect = objc2::msg_send![..., frame];
let backing_frame: CGRect = objc2::msg_send![..., convertRectToBacking: frame];
```

Pattern B — intermediate variable used directly:

```rust
// Before:
let saved_cg = CGRect::new(CGPoint::new(saved_rect.origin.x, ...), ...);
objc2::msg_send![..., setFrame: saved_cg, display: true];

// After:
objc2::msg_send![..., setFrame: saved_rect, display: true];
```

Sites:

| Line | Pattern | What to do                                                   |
| ---- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 346  | A       | Delete `frame_cg`, pass `frame` to `convertRectToBacking`    |
| 348  | A       | Delete `backing_frame`, use `backing_cg` directly            |
| 435  | A       | Delete `frame_cg`, pass `frame` to `contentRectForFrameRect` |
| 437  | A       | Delete `content_frame`, use `content_cg` directly            |
| 667  | A       | Same as 346                                                  |
| 669  | A       | Same as 348                                                  |
| 974  | A       | Same as 346                                                  |
| 976  | A       | Same as 348                                                  |
| 1129 | B       | Delete `saved_cg`, pass `saved_rect` directly                |
| 2318 | A       | Delete `frame_cg`, pass `frame` to `contentRectForFrameRect` |
| 2322 | A       | Delete `frame_cg`, pass `frame` to `convertRectToBacking`    |
| 3475 | A       | Delete `cg_rect`, pass `rect` directly to `initWithFrame`    |

**Smell 8 — `set_var` safety comment** (`listener.rs:21`)

Before:

```rust
std::env::set_var("TERMSURF_SOCKET", &sock_path);
```

After:

```rust
// SAFETY: Called during startup on the main thread before any child
// processes or threads read TERMSURF_SOCKET.
unsafe { std::env::set_var("TERMSURF_SOCKET", &sock_path) };
```

**Smell 11 — Delete dead `TermSurfState`**

Delete `wezboard-gui/src/termsurf/state.rs` entirely. Remove `pub mod state;`
from `wezboard-gui/src/termsurf/mod.rs`.

**Smell 13 — Safety comments on non-obvious unsafe blocks**

Add `// SAFETY:` comments to the `Retained::from_raw` calls (smells 1 & 3 get
proper error handling in a later experiment; for now just document the
invariants). Add comments to the `Box::from_raw` in menu dealloc (updated
above). Don't retrofit comments to inherited upstream unsafe blocks.

#### Verification

1. `cd wezboard && cargo build -p wezboard-gui` — zero errors, zero warnings
2. `cargo run --bin wezboard-gui` — app launches, window opens, terminal works
3. No magic numbers remain (grep for `236isize`, `222isize`, `2_isize`,
   `1u64 /*`, `0u64 /*`, `2u64 /*`)
4. No no-op CGRect re-wrapping remains
5. `state.rs` deleted
6. All new unsafe blocks have `// SAFETY:` comments
