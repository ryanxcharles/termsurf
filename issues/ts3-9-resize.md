# TS3-9: Dynamic Webview Resize (Continued)

Continuation of resize work from [ts3-8-resize.md](./ts3-8-resize.md). The basic
resize pipeline is now functional but exhibits inconsistent behavior.

## Goal

When the user resizes a terminal window or splits a pane, the webview should
dynamically resize to match the new pane dimensions. The resized content should:

1. Fill the pane completely (no gaps, no overflow)
2. Render at correct resolution (not stretched or squished)
3. Maintain crisp text (proper Retina scaling)
4. Respond reliably to all resize events

## Progress Made

### Working

1. **Single source of truth for textures** — The render loop now reads directly
   from `XpcManager::received_surfaces` instead of the disconnected
   `WebviewOverlayState::overlays`. New textures from resize are immediately
   available for rendering.

2. **Bidirectional XPC communication** — GUI can send `resize_browser` commands
   to the profile server. Profile server handles resize and sends new textures
   back.

3. **Resize command pathway** — The full command flow works:
   ```
   GUI detects resize → sends resize_browser via XPC →
   profile calls was_resized() + invalidate() → CEF re-renders →
   profile sends display_surface → GUI receives new texture
   ```

4. **Debounce logic** — 30ms settle delay prevents flooding the profile with
   resize commands during rapid window dragging.

5. **Scale factor conversion** — Logical dimensions (physical / scale) are sent
   to CEF, which expects DIP coordinates.

### Commits

- `f5f53aff8` — Mark experiment 1 as failed: XPC order bug

## What Has Failed

Despite the pipeline being functional, resize behavior is **inconsistent**:

1. **Resize doesn't always trigger** — Sometimes changing the window size causes
   no resize. No predictable pattern for when it works vs doesn't.

2. **Stretched appearance** — Sometimes the webview appears visibly stretched,
   indicating the texture dimensions don't match the viewport dimensions.

3. **Doesn't fill pane** — Sometimes the webview doesn't fill the pane
   dimensions correctly, leaving visible gaps or overflowing the bounds.

4. **Unpredictable** — The same resize action might work correctly one time and
   fail the next.

## Top Hypothesis: Scale Factor Inconsistency

**Initial spawn** uses the pane's DPI from the Mux:

```rust
// webview_socket.rs - spawn_browser handler
let scale = dims.dpi as f32 / 72.0;
```

**Resize** uses the window's DPI from TermWindow:

```rust
// draw.rs - render loop
let scale = self.dimensions.dpi as f32 / 72.0;
```

If `dims.dpi` (pane) differs from `self.dimensions.dpi` (window), the logical
dimensions sent for resize won't match what was used for initial spawn. This
causes the profile to create an IOSurface at the wrong size.

**Evidence:** The stretching and incorrect fill suggest dimension mismatches
rather than complete pipeline failure.

## Other Hypotheses

### 1. Texture/Viewport Transition Period

When resize occurs, there's a window where the old texture is rendered at the
new viewport size:

```
t0: Pane resizes → viewport changes immediately
t1: Resize command sent (after 30ms debounce)
t2: Profile receives, browser resizes
t3: CEF re-renders
t4: New texture sent via XPC
t5: GUI receives and renders new texture
```

During t0-t4, the old texture is stretched to fit the new viewport. If any step
fails or is delayed, stretching persists.

### 2. Debounce Logic Not Triggering

The debounce in `check_and_send_resize` requires:

1. The render loop to run
2. 30ms to elapse since the size changed
3. The size to be different from `last_sent_size`

Problems:

- If terminal content is static (no cursor blink, no animations), the render
  loop might not run frequently
- `last_sent_size` is updated optimistically before confirming the resize
  succeeded
- If resize fails, we don't retry

### 3. Render Loop Timing

Resize detection only happens inside `render_webview_overlays_webgpu`. This
function is only called when the window is being painted. If:

- Terminal content is static
- No cursor blinking
- No animations or updates

...the render loop might not run at the right time to detect size changes.

### 4. Viewport Position Calculation Drift

The viewport is calculated from:

```rust
let x = pos.left as f32 * cell_width + border.left;
let y = pos.top as f32 * cell_height + tab_bar_height + border.top;
let w = pos.pixel_width as f32;
let h = pos.pixel_height as f32;
```

If any of these change without triggering a recalculation:

- Tab bar visibility changes
- Cell size changes
- Border dimensions change

...the viewport won't align with the actual pane position.

### 5. Race Condition in Texture Updates

The XPC handler updates `received_surfaces` while the render loop might be
mid-render using the old texture. While this shouldn't cause stretching (just a
one-frame delay), there might be edge cases where dimensions are read
inconsistently.

### 6. CEF Not Actually Resizing

The profile server calls:

```rust
host.was_resized();
host.invalidate(PaintElementType::default());
```

But we haven't verified that CEF actually re-renders at the new size. Possible
issues:

- `view_rect()` might return stale dimensions
- The browser might not honor the resize immediately
- There might be a minimum time between resize calls

## Files Involved

| File                                               | Role                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ts3/wezterm-gui/src/termwindow/render/draw.rs`    | Resize detection, viewport calculation, texture rendering |
| `ts3/wezterm-gui/src/termwindow/webview_xpc.rs`    | XPC manager, debounce logic, send_resize                  |
| `ts3/wezterm-gui/src/termwindow/webview_socket.rs` | Initial spawn, pane dimension lookup                      |
| `ts3/termsurf-profile/src/main.rs`                 | Resize handler, CEF browser resize, texture sending       |

## Next Steps

1. **Add diagnostic logging** — Compare scale factors between initial spawn and
   resize to verify hypothesis #1

2. **Force render loop** — Ensure the render loop runs after resize events by
   calling `window.invalidate()`

3. **Verify CEF resize** — Add logging in profile server to confirm
   `view_rect()` returns updated dimensions after `was_resized()`

4. **Check debounce state** — Log when debounce prevents resize and when it
   allows resize through

5. **Unify scale factor source** — Use the same DPI source for both initial
   spawn and resize

## Experiments

### Experiment 1: Diagnostic Logging

**Status:** SUCCESS

**Goal:** Add comprehensive logging throughout the resize pipeline to pinpoint
the true cause of inconsistent resize behavior.

#### The Problem

Resize behavior is unpredictable:

- Sometimes resize triggers, sometimes it doesn't
- Sometimes the webview appears stretched
- Sometimes it doesn't fill the pane correctly
- The same action may work one time and fail the next

We have multiple hypotheses but no data to confirm which is correct. Before
attempting fixes, we need visibility into what's actually happening.

#### Logging Strategy

Add logging at 8 key points in the resize pipeline:

| # | Location               | Purpose                            |
| - | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1 | Initial spawn          | Capture baseline dimensions        |
| 2 | Render loop layout     | See pane dimensions from layout    |
| 3 | Debounce logic         | See when resize is sent vs blocked |
| 4 | Profile resize handler | Confirm receipt of resize command  |
| 5 | CEF view_rect          | What dimensions CEF thinks it has  |
| 6 | Texture sending        | Actual IOSurface dimensions        |
| 7 | Texture receiving      | What GUI receives via XPC          |
| 8 | Texture rendering      | Compare texture vs viewport        |

#### Changes

**1. Initial Spawn (webview_socket.rs)**

After calculating dimensions in `spawn_browser` handler:

```rust
log::info!(
    "[SPAWN] pane={} cols={} rows={} cell={}x{} physical={}x{} dpi={} scale={:.2} logical={}x{}",
    pane_id,
    dims.cols,
    dims.viewport_rows,
    cell_width,
    cell_height,
    physical_width,
    physical_height,
    dims.dpi,
    scale,
    lw,
    lh
);
```

**2. Render Loop Layout (draw.rs)**

After finding pane position, before resize check:

```rust
log::info!(
    "[LAYOUT] pane={} pos.left={} pos.top={} pos.pixel={}x{} cell={}x{} window.dpi={}",
    pane_id,
    pos.left,
    pos.top,
    pos.pixel_width,
    pos.pixel_height,
    self.render_metrics.cell_size.width,
    self.render_metrics.cell_size.height,
    self.dimensions.dpi
);
```

**3. Debounce Logic (webview_xpc.rs)**

At the start of `check_and_send_resize`:

```rust
log::info!(
    "[DEBOUNCE] pane={} current={}x{} last_sent={:?} pending={:?}",
    pane_id,
    width,
    height,
    state.last_sent_size,
    state.pending_resize.map(|(w, h, t)| (w, h, t.elapsed().as_millis()))
);
```

When resize is actually sent:

```rust
log::info!("[DEBOUNCE] pane={} SENDING {}x{}", pane_id, w, h);
```

When resize is skipped (add new log):

```rust
// If size unchanged from last_sent
log::info!("[DEBOUNCE] pane={} SKIP size unchanged", pane_id);

// If still waiting for settle delay
log::info!(
    "[DEBOUNCE] pane={} WAIT {}ms remaining",
    pane_id,
    (SETTLE_DELAY - time.elapsed()).as_millis()
);
```

**4. Profile Resize Handler (termsurf-profile/src/main.rs)**

When resize command is received:

```rust
println!(
    "[RESIZE-RX] width={} height={} prev_state={}x{}",
    width,
    height,
    bs.width.load(Ordering::Relaxed),
    bs.height.load(Ordering::Relaxed)
);
```

After calling `was_resized()`:

```rust
println!("[RESIZE-RX] called was_resized() and invalidate()");
```

**5. CEF view_rect (termsurf-profile/src/main.rs)**

In the `view_rect` callback:

```rust
println!(
    "[VIEW_RECT] returning {}x{}",
    w,
    h
);
```

**6. Texture Sending (termsurf-profile/src/main.rs)**

In `on_accelerated_paint` when sending:

```rust
println!(
    "[TEXTURE-TX] handle={:p} iosurface={}x{} view_rect={}x{}",
    handle,
    info.width,
    info.height,
    self.state.width.load(Ordering::Relaxed),
    self.state.height.load(Ordering::Relaxed)
);
```

**7. Texture Receiving (webview_xpc.rs)**

In the XPC handler for `display_surface`:

```rust
log::info!(
    "[TEXTURE-RX] pane={} mach_port={} size={}x{}",
    pane_id,
    port,
    width,
    height
);
```

**8. Texture Rendering (draw.rs)**

Before importing the texture:

```rust
log::info!(
    "[RENDER] pane={} texture={}x{} viewport={}x{} match={}",
    pane_id,
    surface.width,
    surface.height,
    viewport_w as u32,
    viewport_h as u32,
    surface.width == viewport_w as u32 && surface.height == viewport_h as u32
);
```

#### What Each Log Reveals

| Issue                  | Log to Check        | What to Look For                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Resize doesn't trigger | [DEBOUNCE]          | SKIP or WAIT instead of SENDING     |
| Stretched appearance   | [RENDER]            | texture size != viewport size       |
| Doesn't fill pane      | [LAYOUT] vs [SPAWN] | pixel dimensions differ             |
| Profile not resizing   | [RESIZE-RX]         | Missing or wrong dimensions         |
| CEF not updating       | [VIEW_RECT]         | Returns old dimensions after resize |
| Wrong texture sent     | [TEXTURE-TX]        | iosurface size != view_rect size    |

#### Success Criteria

- [x] All 8 logging points are implemented
- [x] Logs are parseable with grep patterns
- [x] Can trace a complete resize from detection to render
- [x] Can identify WHERE in the pipeline failures occur
- [x] Have data to inform Experiment 2 (the actual fix)

#### Findings

Logging revealed the true causes of inconsistent resize behavior:

**1. Viewport updates correctly, texture lags far behind**

The pane dimensions (`pos.pixel`) update on every frame during resize:

```
pos.pixel=2054x1920 → 2002x1890 → 1898x1800 → ... → 1599x1590
```

But the texture only updates after: (a) user stops resizing for 30ms, (b) resize
command sent via XPC, (c) CEF re-renders, (d) new IOSurface sent back. This
takes **1-1.5 seconds** total.

**2. Debounce resets continuously during active resize**

Every frame during resize changes the viewport size, which resets the 30ms
debounce timer. Resize commands only send after the user **completely stops**
resizing for 30ms:

```
[DEBOUNCE] pane=0 current=1040x1080 last_sent=None pending=Some((1040, 1080, 1515))
[DEBOUNCE] pane=0 SENDING 1040x1080  ← only after 30ms of no changes
```

This is correct debounce behavior, but means texture is always wrong during
active resize.

**3. Texture/viewport mismatch causes stretching**

The `[RENDER]` logs show `match=false` almost continuously during resize:

```
[RENDER] pane=0 texture=2820x2130 viewport=1599x1590 match=false  ← stretched!
[RENDER] pane=0 texture=1598x1590 viewport=2990x2190 match=false  ← stretched!
[RENDER] pane=0 texture=2990x2190 viewport=2990x2190 match=true   ← finally correct
```

The texture is rendered at its native size into a differently-sized viewport,
causing the stretched appearance.

**4. CEF pipeline is working correctly**

The profile logs show CEF is doing its job:

```
[RESIZE-RX] session=pane-0-2208 width=799 height=795 prev=1040x1080
[VIEW_RECT] session=pane-0-2208 returning 799x795
[TEXTURE-TX] session=pane-0-2208 iosurface=1598x1590 view_rect=799x795
```

CEF receives resize, updates view_rect, and sends correctly-sized IOSurface
(1598×1590 = 799×2 × 795×2 for Retina). The issue is timing, not CEF.

#### Root Cause Summary

| Symptom                   | Actual Cause                                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Usually doesn't resize"  | Debounce keeps resetting during active resize; only sends when user stops for 30ms |
| "Wrong size when it does" | By the time new texture arrives (1+ second), user has already changed size again   |
| "Stretched appearance"    | Texture rendered 1:1 but viewport size has changed, causing aspect ratio mismatch  |

#### Conclusion

The resize **pipeline** works correctly. The problem is the **rendering
strategy**: we render the texture at its native size, but the viewport changes
continuously during resize. This causes a persistent mismatch.

**Potential fixes for Experiment 2:**

1. **Scale texture to fit viewport** — Instead of rendering texture 1:1, scale
   it to fill the viewport. Will be slightly blurry but not stretched.

2. **Send resize more aggressively** — Send interim resizes during active drag
   (every 100ms?) instead of only after stopping.

3. **Speed up CEF response** — Investigate why it takes 1+ seconds for CEF to
   produce a new texture after resize command.

---

### Experiment 2: Remove Debounce

**Status:** SUCCESS

**Goal:** Remove the 30ms debounce logic entirely and send resize commands on
every frame where the size changes. This tests whether CEF can keep up with
rapid resize commands and whether removing the debounce improves perceived
responsiveness.

#### Hypothesis

The 30ms debounce was added to prevent "flooding" the profile server with resize
commands. But Experiment 1 showed that the debounce causes resize commands to
only fire after the user completely stops dragging, resulting in a 1+ second
delay before the correct texture appears.

If we remove the debounce:

- **Best case:** CEF keeps up, textures arrive faster, resize feels responsive
- **Worst case:** XPC/CEF gets overwhelmed, performance degrades, but we learn
  the actual bottleneck

Either outcome provides valuable data.

#### Changes

**webview_xpc.rs — Remove debounce logic**

Replace `check_and_send_resize` with a simpler version that sends immediately
when size changes:

```rust
/// Send resize command immediately if size changed from last sent.
/// No debouncing — send on every frame where size differs.
pub fn check_and_send_resize(&self, pane_id: PaneId, width: u32, height: u32) -> bool {
    let current_size = (width, height);

    let mut debounce = self.resize_debounce.lock().unwrap();
    let state = debounce.entry(pane_id).or_insert(ResizeDebounceState {
        last_sent_size: None,
        pending_resize: None,
    });

    // Only send if size actually changed
    if state.last_sent_size == Some(current_size) {
        return false;
    }

    log::info!(
        "[RESIZE] pane={} SENDING {}x{} (was {:?})",
        pane_id,
        width,
        height,
        state.last_sent_size
    );

    state.last_sent_size = Some(current_size);
    state.pending_resize = None;
    drop(debounce);

    self.send_resize(pane_id, width, height)
}
```

```

#### What We're Testing

| Question                        | How to Measure                         |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Can CEF handle rapid resize?    | Watch for lag, dropped frames, crashes |
| Does removing debounce help UX? | Subjective: does resize feel smoother? |
| What's the actual bottleneck?   | Compare send count vs receive count    |
| Is XPC the limiting factor?     | Check if commands are lost or delayed  |

#### Success Criteria

- [x] Resize commands sent on every size change (no 30ms wait)
- [x] App remains stable during rapid resize
- [x] Determine if debounce removal improves or worsens UX
- [x] Identify actual bottleneck if UX doesn't improve

#### Risks

- **Performance degradation** — Flooding XPC/CEF with resize commands could
  cause lag or dropped frames
- **Resource exhaustion** — Rapid IOSurface creation could exhaust GPU memory
- **Race conditions** — More resize commands in flight increases chance of
  ordering issues

If performance degrades significantly, we'll know the debounce was necessary and
can explore middle-ground solutions (e.g., 10ms debounce, or throttle to 60fps).

#### Outcome

Removing debounce entirely fixed the resize behavior. Resize commands now fire
immediately when size changes, and the webview updates responsively during drag.
Some remaining issues exist but are unrelated to debounce timing.

---

### Experiment 3: Correct Debounce Pattern (from ts2)

**Status:** PENDING

**Goal:** Implement the correct debounce pattern from ts2, which properly waits
for size to "settle" before sending resize commands. This provides the best of
both worlds: responsive resize during drag AND reduced XPC traffic.

#### Background

Experiment 2 removed debounce entirely and worked, but sends many resize
commands during drag (potentially wasteful). ts2 has a debounce that works
perfectly. The difference:

**ts3's broken debounce (Experiment 1):**

```rust
// BUG: Timer reset EVERY frame because we compared to last_sent_size
if state.last_sent_size != Some(current_size) {
    if state.pending_resize.map(|(w, h, _)| (w, h)) != Some(current_size) {
        state.pending_resize = Some((width, height, now));  // Timer reset!
    }
}
```

Since `last_sent_size` is `None` until we actually send, every frame saw a
"change" and reset the timer. The 30ms never elapsed until dragging stopped.

**ts2's correct debounce:**

```rust
// Only reset timer when TARGET changes (not when it differs from sent)
if browser.get_pending_size() != Some(target_size) {
    browser.set_pending_size(logical_width, logical_height);
    browser.mark_resize_time();  // Timer resets ONLY here
}

// Check if we've waited long enough since target last changed
if let Some(elapsed) = browser.time_since_last_resize() {
    if elapsed >= SETTLE_DELAY {
        browser.resize(logical_width, logical_height);
        browser.clear_resize_time();
        browser.clear_pending_size();
    } else {
        // CRITICAL: Ensure render loop runs again to check timer
        self.window.invalidate();
    }
}
```

The key insight: **reset timer only when the target size changes, not when it
differs from what we last sent.**

#### The Pattern

ts2 puts the debounce logic **inline in the render function**, not in a separate
method. This gives direct access to `self.window` for invalidation.

Three pieces of state per pane:

| State             | Purpose                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `pending_size`    | The target size we want to resize to       |
| `pending_since`   | When the target last changed (timer start) |
| `last_sent_size`  | What we last sent via XPC (for dedup)      |

**Why ts3 needs `last_sent_size` but ts2 doesn't:**

- ts2's `browser.resize()` is in-process and synchronous — resizing to the same
  size is a cheap no-op
- ts3's resize goes over XPC and triggers IOSurface recreation — redundant
  resizes would flood the profile server

Without `last_sent_size`, after sending we'd clear `pending_size`, then on the
next frame see `None != Some(current)` and start the timer again, creating an
infinite loop of resizes every 30ms.

Flow:

1. Fast path: if `last_sent_size == current`, skip (already correct)
2. If `pending_size != current`: update `pending_size`, reset timer
3. If `pending_size == current`: check if 30ms elapsed
4. If elapsed: send resize, record in `last_sent_size`, clear pending
5. If not elapsed: call `window.invalidate()` to ensure we check again

This means:

- During fast drag: timer keeps resetting, no resize sent (debounced)
- When drag slows/stops: timer runs out, resize sent
- After send: `last_sent_size` prevents re-triggering until size changes
- **Critical:** `window.invalidate()` ensures render loop runs to check timer

#### Changes

**webview_xpc.rs — Simplify to just state + send**

Keep `ResizeDebounceState` but remove the debounce logic from `check_and_send_resize`.
The method becomes a simple state accessor + sender:

```rust
/// State for debouncing resize commands (ts2 pattern + last_sent for XPC dedup).
pub struct ResizeDebounceState {
    /// The target size we want to resize to
    pub pending_size: Option<(u32, u32)>,
    /// When pending_size last changed (timer start)
    pub pending_since: Option<Instant>,
    /// What we last sent via XPC (prevents infinite loop after send)
    /// Note: ts2 doesn't need this because in-process resize is a cheap no-op.
    /// ts3 needs it because XPC resize triggers IOSurface recreation.
    pub last_sent_size: Option<(u32, u32)>,
}

impl XpcManager {
    /// Get mutable access to debounce state for a pane.
    pub fn get_resize_state(&self, pane_id: PaneId) -> std::sync::MutexGuard<'_, HashMap<PaneId, ResizeDebounceState>> {
        self.resize_debounce.lock().unwrap()
    }

    /// Send resize command to profile server.
    pub fn send_resize(&self, pane_id: PaneId, width: u32, height: u32) -> bool {
        // ... existing send_resize implementation ...
    }
}
```

**draw.rs — Inline debounce logic (like ts2)**

In `render_webview_overlays_webgpu`, replace the `check_and_send_resize` call
with inline debounce logic:

```rust
// Inside render_webview_overlays_webgpu, after calculating logical_w/logical_h:

use std::time::{Duration, Instant};
const SETTLE_DELAY: Duration = Duration::from_millis(30);

let target_size = (logical_w, logical_h);

if let Some(xpc_manager) = crate::termwindow::webview_xpc::get_xpc_manager() {
    let mut debounce = xpc_manager.get_resize_state(*pane_id);
    let state = debounce.entry(*pane_id).or_insert(ResizeDebounceState {
        pending_size: None,
        pending_since: None,
        last_sent_size: None,
    });

    // Fast path: size unchanged from last sent, nothing to do
    // This prevents infinite loop: send → clear pending → set pending → send...
    if state.last_sent_size == Some(target_size) {
        state.pending_size = None;
        state.pending_since = None;
        drop(debounce);
        // Already at correct size, skip debounce logic
    } else {
        // Check if target size changed (compare against pending, not sent)
        if state.pending_size != Some(target_size) {
            state.pending_size = Some(target_size);
            state.pending_since = Some(Instant::now());
            log::debug!(
                "[DEBOUNCE] pane={} target changed to {}x{}",
                pane_id, logical_w, logical_h
            );
        }

        // Settle-and-send logic
        if let Some(since) = state.pending_since {
            let elapsed = since.elapsed();
            if elapsed >= SETTLE_DELAY {
                log::info!(
                    "[DEBOUNCE] pane={} SENDING {}x{} (settled {:?})",
                    pane_id, logical_w, logical_h, elapsed
                );
                // Record what we sent and clear pending state
                state.last_sent_size = Some(target_size);
                state.pending_size = None;
                state.pending_since = None;
                drop(debounce);  // Release lock before XPC call
                xpc_manager.send_resize(*pane_id, logical_w, logical_h);
            } else {
                // Not settled yet — ensure render loop runs again
                drop(debounce);  // Release lock before window call
                if let Some(ref w) = self.window {
                    w.invalidate();
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `ts3/wezterm-gui/src/termwindow/webview_xpc.rs`  | Simplify: expose state, keep send_resize  |
| `ts3/wezterm-gui/src/termwindow/render/draw.rs`  | Inline debounce logic with invalidate()   |

#### Why Inline Matters

The previous approach put debounce logic in `XpcManager::check_and_send_resize`,
which had no access to `self.window`. Without `window.invalidate()`:

- If terminal content is static (no cursor blink, no animations)
- The render loop might not run frequently
- The 30ms timer could expire but never get checked

By inlining the logic in `draw.rs` (like ts2), we have direct access to
`self.window` and can ensure the render loop keeps running while waiting.

#### Verification

```bash
cd ts3 && ./scripts/build-debug.sh --open

# Test 1: Fast drag (debounce should activate)
web google.com
# Rapidly drag window edge
# Watch logs: should see "target changed" but few "SENDING"
tail -f /tmp/termsurf-gui.log | grep "\[DEBOUNCE\]"

# Test 2: Slow drag (should send on each pause)
# Slowly drag, pausing occasionally
# Watch logs: should see "SENDING" after each 30ms pause

# Test 3: Compare with Experiment 2
cat /tmp/termsurf-gui.log | grep "SENDING" | wc -l
# Expected: Fewer sends than Experiment 2, but still responsive

# Test 4: Static terminal (cursor blink disabled)
# Resize window, then stop
# Verify resize still fires after 30ms (invalidate working)
```

#### Expected Behavior

| Scenario            | Experiment 1 (broken) | Experiment 2 (no debounce) | Experiment 3 (fixed) |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Fast continuous drag| No sends until stop   | Send every frame           | No sends until pause |
| Drag with pauses    | Send after each stop  | Send every frame           | Send after 30ms pause|
| Stable size         | No sends              | No sends                   | No sends             |
| XPC traffic         | Low but delayed       | High                       | Moderate             |
| Static terminal     | Timer never fires     | N/A                        | Timer fires (invalidate) |

#### Success Criteria

- [ ] Debounce logic is inline in draw.rs (like ts2)
- [ ] `window.invalidate()` called when waiting for timer
- [ ] Timer only resets when target size changes
- [ ] Resize sends after 30ms of stable target
- [ ] Fewer resize commands than Experiment 2
- [ ] Works even with static terminal content
