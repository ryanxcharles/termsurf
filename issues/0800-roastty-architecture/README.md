# Issue 800: Roastty Architecture and ABI Skeleton

## Goal

Document the planned architecture for Roastty, implement the first Rust ABI
skeleton that can eventually replace Ghostty's `libghostty`, and set the stage
for the remaining Ghostty-to-Rust rewrite.

Roastty is a macOS-first Rust reimplementation of Ghostty. The initial target is
feature parity with Ghostty as a terminal emulator, before adding TermSurf's
browser-overlay features.

## Background

TermSurf currently uses Wezboard, a WezTerm fork, as the active GUI. Wezboard
works, but recent work exposed architectural friction in areas that matter to
TermSurf: grid-native borders, pane geometry, browser overlays, and split
presentation all required careful changes inside a terminal architecture that
was not designed around TermSurf's browser-overlay model.

Ghostty has a more promising shape for a future TermSurf GUI:

- a native macOS frontend written in Swift/AppKit/SwiftUI;
- a reusable terminal core exposed through `libghostty`;
- a C ABI boundary between the native app and the terminal engine;
- a surface model where the app runtime decides whether a terminal surface is a
  window, tab, split, preview pane, or something else;
- a Metal renderer on macOS;
- a clean separation between terminal state, PTY/IO, rendering, fonts, config,
  and native application UI.

The vendored Ghostty repository is tracked under `vendor/ghostty/`. As of the
start of this issue, it has been updated to upstream main at:

`2c62d182c gtk: fix context menu hiding quick-terminal (#12843)`

## Planned Architecture

Roastty should not begin as a from-scratch macOS application rewrite. The
practical path is to keep Ghostty's Swift macOS app as the reference frontend
and gradually replace the Zig `libghostty` implementation with a Rust
`libroastty` implementation behind a C ABI.

The target architecture is:

└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The first milestone is not a working terminal. It is an ABI skeleton: a Rust
library that exposes enough `ghostty_*`-shaped C symbols for the Swift app, or a
small compatibility harness, to load and exercise app/config/surface lifecycle
without linking Zig `libghostty`.

## Ghostty Reference Layers

The relevant Ghostty layers are:

- `vendor/ghostty/include/ghostty.h` — full C ABI used by the Swift app:
  `ghostty_app_t`, `ghostty_surface_t`, config handles, input, mouse, clipboard,
  actions, lifecycle, and rendering-related callbacks.
- `vendor/ghostty/include/ghostty/vt.h` — lower-level virtual terminal library
  API. This is the best reference for Roastty's terminal-core boundary.
- `vendor/ghostty/src/App.zig` — core app state, surface list, focus, config
  propagation, and mailbox tick loop.
- `vendor/ghostty/src/Surface.zig` — the central terminal surface abstraction:
  PTY, renderer, renderer state, terminal IO, input, mouse, search, inspector,
  focus, config, and child process lifecycle.
- `vendor/ghostty/src/apprt.zig` and `vendor/ghostty/src/apprt/embedded.zig` —
  application-runtime abstraction. On macOS, Ghostty builds as an embedded
  library and the Swift app supplies runtime callbacks.
- `vendor/ghostty/src/terminal/` — terminal emulator state: parser, screens,
  scrollback, selection, OSC/CSI/DCS handling, mouse/key encoding, Kitty
  graphics, and render-state extraction.
- `vendor/ghostty/src/termio/` — PTY/subprocess/IO threads.
- `vendor/ghostty/src/renderer/` — renderer abstraction and Metal backend.
- `vendor/ghostty/src/font/` — font discovery, CoreText backend, shaping,
  fallback, glyph atlas, metrics, emoji, and sprite handling.
- `vendor/ghostty/macos/Sources/` — Swift native macOS app, including tabs,
  splits, terminal views, settings, menus, quick terminal, AppleScript,
  AppIntents, native input, pasteboard, and platform integration.

## Rewrite Order

The rewrite should proceed in layers. Each layer should be verified before the
next layer is designed.

1. **ABI inventory and skeleton**

   Identify the minimum `ghostty_*` API surface the macOS app needs to create an
   app, create a surface, resize it, focus it, tick the event loop, and destroy
   it. Implement no-op or stubbed Rust versions behind a C ABI.

2. **Config and lifecycle**

   Implement enough config loading, diagnostics, cloning, and cleanup for the
   Swift app to launch without depending on Zig config internals.

3. **Terminal core**

   Reimplement the virtual terminal state: parser, screen/grid, scrollback,
   cursor, style, SGR/OSC/CSI/DCS handling, selection, resize/reflow, and
   terminal input encoding.

4. **PTY and IO**

   Spawn the shell, manage the PTY, resize it, read output, write input, track
   foreground process information, and report child exit.

5. **Render state**

   Convert terminal state into a renderer-friendly row/cell/cursor/selection
   model. This should be validated independently before full Metal parity.

6. **Minimal macOS renderer**

   Render a basic text grid into the Ghostty-derived surface. The first renderer
   can be plain; the goal is correctness and ABI integration, not final
   performance.

7. **Metal renderer parity**

   Port the production renderer pieces: Metal layer setup, command queues,
   textures, glyph atlas, cursor rendering, selections, decorations, and redraw
   scheduling.

8. **Font and text parity**

   Implement CoreText discovery, font fallback, shaping, ligatures, emoji, Nerd
   Font glyphs, cell metrics, and glyph caching.

9. **Input, keybindings, mouse, and clipboard**

   Match Ghostty's keyboard layout handling, keybinding action model, mouse
   modes, scroll behavior, paste behavior, OSC 52, IME/preedit, and clipboard
   confirmation flow.

10. **Native app feature parity**

    Bring the Swift frontend back to parity with Ghostty behavior: tabs, splits,
    zoom, quick terminal, settings, menus, command palette, AppleScript,
    AppIntents, notifications, secure input, inspector, and update-adjacent
    behavior where relevant.

11. **TermSurf integration**

    Add TermSurf browser overlays, protocol routing, Roamium integration, and
    browser/terminal surface composition only after Roastty is a credible
    Ghostty-compatible terminal on macOS.

## Non-Goals

- Do not add TermSurf browser overlays before terminal parity work has a stable
  surface model.
- Do not rewrite the Swift app first. The Swift app is valuable reference UI and
  should initially be reused or lightly adapted.
- Do not attempt a big-bang full Ghostty rewrite. Each subsystem needs an
  experiment, verification, and result.
- Do not claim compatibility from symbol presence alone. A stub ABI only proves
  linking and lifecycle shape, not terminal behavior.
- Do not target Linux, Windows, or a full cross-platform story during the first
  Roastty phase. This issue is macOS-first.

## Expected First Experiment

The first experiment should create the top-level Rust workspace that will host
Roastty and TermSurf-owned shared Rust crates while keeping Wezboard separate.

## Experiments

- [Experiment 1: Create the TermSurf Rust workspace](01-termsurf-rust-workspace.md)
  — **Pass**

## Original Expected ABI Experiment

After the workspace exists, the next experiment should implement the ABI
skeleton.

It should:

- create the initial `roastty/` Rust crate layout;
- choose the C ABI compatibility strategy;
- inventory the `ghostty_*` symbols used by the macOS Swift app;
- implement opaque Rust handles for app, config, and surface lifecycle;
- expose a minimal set of C symbols with stable ownership rules;
- add a tiny C or Rust integration test that loads the library, creates config,
  app, and surface handles, calls the tick/focus/resize lifecycle, and frees
  everything cleanly;
- avoid implementing real terminal emulation, PTY, rendering, or font logic.

The result should leave the repo ready for the next experiment: either wiring
the Swift app to the stub library, or expanding the skeleton to cover the next
required API group discovered during symbol inventory.
