# Issue 642: Zig Profile Server

## Goal

Rewrite the Chromium Profile Server in Zig. Keep a thin C++ shim for Content API
subclassing (the only thing that requires C++), but move all application logic —
XPC handling, tab lifecycle, input routing, navigation, state notifications —
into Zig. The result is a new build target called `zig_profile_server` that
replaces `chromium_profile_server`.

## Background

### Why rewrite in Zig

The current Chromium Profile Server is a Content Shell fork: ~100 C++ files, of
which ~1,050 lines are TermSurf-specific logic. The rest is unmodified Content
Shell boilerplate. Three reasons to rewrite:

1. **Language consistency.** The GUI is written in Zig. The profile server is
   the only TermSurf component written in C++. Having both in Zig means one
   language to maintain, one set of idioms, one mental model.

2. **Maintainability.** The Content Shell fork carries 100+ files we never
   modify. Every Chromium upgrade risks conflicts in boilerplate we don't own. A
   thin C++ shim (3 files) with Zig logic is easier to understand, modify, and
   upgrade.

3. **Developer experience.** Zig is more modern and more enjoyable to work in
   than C++. Comptime, explicit allocators, no header files, no preprocessor
   soup. The same reasons we chose Zig for the GUI apply here.

### What Issue 620 proved

Issue 620 built a minimal Chromium embedder (3 files, ~190 lines) that drives
the Content API through a C function boundary. 15 experiments proved:

- The Content API can be driven from a C `main()` via dlopen/dlsym
- Multiple BrowserContexts coexist in one process with isolated storage
- A custom launcher with zero Chromium headers can create profiles, tabs, and
  manage lifecycle through C function pointers
- `WebContents` can be created directly and their NSView attached to custom
  windows

The in-process multi-profile goal was shelved (Blink main thread scheduling
blocks 60fps for JS-heavy pages across two BrowserContexts — Issue 621). But the
C API shim architecture is exactly what we need for the out-of-process Zig
Profile Server.

### What Issue 620 did NOT cover

Issue 620's shim was a proof-of-concept. It did not implement:

- XPC communication (the gateway connection, message dispatch, response sending)
- Input forwarding (mouse, keyboard, scroll events → RenderWidgetHost)
- CALayerHost / persistent compositor (CAContext stability across navigation)
- WebContents observation (URL, title, loading state, cursor changes)
- Dock icon hiding, focus management, auto-exit
- Navigation actions (back, forward, reload, navigate-to-URL)
- New-tab link interception (redirect to same tab)
- Page title sync

All of these currently live in C++ in the Content Shell fork. They need to move
to Zig.

### What the current profile server does

The Chromium Profile Server runs out-of-process and:

1. **Accepts XPC commands** from the GUI: create/destroy tabs, navigate, resize,
   set focus, forward input events
2. **Observes WebContents** for URL, title, loading state, cursor changes and
   sends updates back via XPC
3. **Forwards input** (mouse, keyboard, scroll) from XPC messages to Chromium
   via the Content API's RenderWidgetHost
4. **Renders via persistent compositor** with stable CAContext — no
   `ca_context_id` flicker on navigation (Issue 633)
5. **Manages visibility/focus** to keep the compositor at full framerate
6. **Intercepts new-tab links** and redirects them to the current tab
   (Issue 639)
7. **Hides the Dock icon** via LSUIElement and runtime NSApplication policy

### Current file structure

The profile server lives at `chromium/src/content/chromium_profile_server/` with
~100 files inherited from Content Shell. TermSurf-specific logic (~1,050 lines)
is spread across:

| File                                     | Lines | What it does                                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `browser/shell_browser_main_parts.cc`    | ~590  | XPC gateway, tab/profile lifecycle, persistent compositor |
| `browser/shell_tab_observer.cc`          | ~200  | URL/title/loading/cursor notifications                    |
| `browser/shell.cc`                       | ~150  | Input forwarding, new-tab interception                    |
| `browser/shell_compositor_bridge_mac.mm` | ~60   | Persistent compositor bridge                              |
| Various                                  | ~50   | Dock hiding, focus, auto-exit                             |

## Chromium Branch

`146.0.7650.0-issue-642` — forked from the vanilla `146.0.7650.0` tag, NOT from
`issue-639` or any other TermSurf branch.

The whole point of the Zig Profile Server is to eliminate the Content Shell
fork. The current profile server (`chromium_profile_server`) carries 42 patches
from `termsurf` through `issue-639` — most of which modify Content Shell
internals. The new branch starts clean: just 3 new files in
`content/zig_profile_server/` (BUILD.gn, header, implementation). No
modifications to existing Chromium source.

This means:

- **Tiny patch set.** Three new files vs 42 inherited patches.
- **Trivial upgrades.** Rebasing 3 new files onto a new Chromium tag is easy.
  Rebasing 42 patches that touch Content Shell internals is fragile.
- **No contamination.** The branch doesn't carry persistent compositor hacks,
  XPC gateway wiring, dock icon patches, or any other Content Shell
  modifications. Those all move to Zig.

For reference during implementation, the old profile server's logic is preserved
in `chromium/patches/issue-639/` and the `146.0.7650.0-issue-639` branch.

## Architecture

### C++ shim (inside `chromium/src/`)

A thin C++ layer (~3 files) that subclasses Content API virtual classes and
exports C functions. This is the same pattern as Issue 620's `content_api_shim`,
extended to cover the full feature set. Must live inside `chromium/src/` because
GN can only see files rooted there.

The shim handles:

- `ContentMainDelegate`, `ContentBrowserClient`, `BrowserMainParts` subclassing
- `WebContentsDelegate`, `WebContentsObserver` subclassing
- `BrowserContext` lifecycle
- Lifecycle callbacks (initialized, shutdown)
- All forwarding to/from Zig via C function pointers

The shim does NOT contain application logic. It is mechanical glue.

### Zig profile server (in the main repo)

All application logic lives in Zig:

- XPC gateway connection and message dispatch
- Tab lifecycle (create, destroy, navigate)
- Input event translation and forwarding (via C shim functions)
- WebContents state observation callbacks (URL, title, loading, cursor)
- Persistent compositor management
- CAContext ID extraction and reporting
- Dock icon hiding
- Focus management
- Auto-exit when all tabs close
- New-tab link interception

### C API surface

Based on Issue 620's proven API, extended for the full feature set:

```c
/* Initialization */
int ts_content_main(int argc, const char** argv);
void ts_set_on_initialized(void (*callback)(void));
void ts_set_on_shutdown(void (*callback)(void));

/* Profile management */
typedef void* ts_browser_context_t;
ts_browser_context_t ts_create_browser_context(const char* path);
void ts_destroy_browser_context(ts_browser_context_t ctx);

/* Tab management */
typedef void* ts_web_contents_t;
ts_web_contents_t ts_create_web_contents(ts_browser_context_t ctx,
                                         const char* url);
void ts_destroy_web_contents(ts_web_contents_t wc);

/* Navigation */
void ts_load_url(ts_web_contents_t wc, const char* url);
void ts_go_back(ts_web_contents_t wc);
void ts_go_forward(ts_web_contents_t wc);
void ts_reload(ts_web_contents_t wc);

/* Input */
void ts_forward_mouse_event(ts_web_contents_t wc, int type,
                            int x, int y, int button, int mods);
void ts_forward_scroll_event(ts_web_contents_t wc,
                             int x, int y, float dx, float dy,
                             int phase, int mods);
void ts_forward_key_event(ts_web_contents_t wc, int type,
                          int keycode, const char* text, int mods);
void ts_set_focus(ts_web_contents_t wc, bool focused);

/* Display */
uint32_t ts_get_ca_context_id(ts_web_contents_t wc);
void ts_set_view_size(ts_web_contents_t wc, int width, int height);

/* Lifecycle */
void ts_quit(void);

/* Callbacks (Zig registers these before calling ts_content_main) */
void ts_set_on_navigation_committed(
    void (*cb)(ts_web_contents_t wc, const char* url));
void ts_set_on_loading_state_changed(
    void (*cb)(ts_web_contents_t wc, bool loading, float progress));
void ts_set_on_cursor_changed(
    void (*cb)(ts_web_contents_t wc, int cursor_type));
void ts_set_on_title_changed(
    void (*cb)(ts_web_contents_t wc, const char* title));
void ts_set_on_ca_context_id_changed(
    void (*cb)(ts_web_contents_t wc, uint32_t ca_context_id));
```

### Build

Two-step build, same as Issue 620:

1. Build the C++ shim inside Chromium (produces shared library):

   ```bash
   cd chromium/src
   autoninja -C out/Default zig_profile_server_shim
   ```

2. Build the Zig profile server (links against the shim):
   ```bash
   cd browser
   zig build
   ```

The Zig binary dlopen's the shim framework, dlsym's all C API symbols, registers
callbacks, and calls `ts_content_main`. Same pattern proven in Issue 620
Experiment 4.

## Relationship to Issue 620

Issue 620 proved the architecture. This issue builds the production
implementation. The key differences:

|               | Issue 620                             | Issue 642                             |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Goal          | Prove C API works, explore in-process | Production profile server             |
| Process model | In-process experiment                 | Out-of-process (same as current)      |
| XPC           | None                                  | Full gateway + message dispatch       |
| Input         | None                                  | Mouse, keyboard, scroll forwarding    |
| Display       | Basic NSView attachment               | Persistent compositor, CALayerHost    |
| Observation   | None                                  | URL, title, loading, cursor callbacks |
| Shim size     | ~190 lines                            | ~800 lines (estimated)                |
| Zig code      | None (C launcher only)                | Full application logic                |

## Plan

### Stage 1: C++ shim with minimal Zig launcher

Build the C++ shim inside `chromium/src/content/zig_profile_server/` with the
core API (init, profile, tab, quit). Write a minimal Zig launcher that dlopen's
the shim, creates one profile, loads one page, and displays it in a Shell
window. Prove the Issue 620 Experiment 4 result still works.

### Stage 2: Direct WebContents and CAContext

Extend the shim with `ts_create_web_contents`, `ts_get_ca_context_id`,
`ts_set_view_size`. The Zig launcher creates WebContents directly (no Shell
window) and reports the CAContext ID. Prove the display pipeline works.

### Stage 3: XPC gateway in Zig

Implement the XPC gateway connection in Zig. The Zig profile server connects to
the GUI's XPC listener and begins accepting commands. Port the create-tab,
destroy-tab, and resize XPC handlers from C++ to Zig.

### Stage 4: Input forwarding

Port mouse, keyboard, and scroll event forwarding. The Zig code receives XPC
input messages and calls the C shim's `ts_forward_*` functions.

### Stage 5: WebContents observation

Port URL, title, loading state, and cursor change observation. The C++ shim
fires callbacks into Zig, which sends XPC messages back to the GUI.

### Stage 6: Navigation and remaining features

Port navigation actions (back, forward, reload, navigate-to-URL), new-tab link
interception, dock icon hiding, focus management, and auto-exit.

### Stage 7: Replace chromium_profile_server

Once the Zig Profile Server has feature parity, switch the GUI to connect to it
instead of the C++ profile server. Remove the old `chromium_profile_server`
target.

## Experiments

### Experiment 1: Zig drives ContentMain

Prove that a Zig binary can dlopen the Chromium framework, register a callback,
and drive `ContentMain` to display a web page. This is the thinnest possible
end-to-end proof of the Zig-to-Chromium bridge.

Issue 620 Experiment 4 proved this from a C/ObjC launcher (`ts_main.mm`). This
experiment proves it from Zig. Everything else in this issue is incremental once
this works.

#### Chromium side

Create the branch `146.0.7650.0-issue-642` from the vanilla `146.0.7650.0` tag.
Add 3 files in `chromium/src/content/zig_profile_server/`:

**`BUILD.gn`** — Build target. The key difference from the old
`chromium_profile_server`: this target depends on
`//content/shell:content_shell_lib` (linking against Content Shell as a
library), not forking it. No Content Shell files are copied or modified.

**`content_api_shim.h`** — C header with 4 exports:

```c
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif

typedef void (*ts_callback_t)(void);

// Register a callback that fires when the browser is ready.
void ts_set_on_initialized(ts_callback_t callback);

// Create a browser profile with the given storage path.
typedef void* ts_browser_context_t;
ts_browser_context_t ts_create_browser_context(const char* path);

// Create a tab (Shell window) in the given profile, loading the URL.
void ts_create_tab(ts_browser_context_t ctx, const char* url);

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif
```

`ContentMain` is not declared here — it is dlsym'd from the framework directly
(same pattern as `shell_main_mac.cc`).

**`content_api_shim.cc`** — C++ implementation. Subclasses `ShellMainDelegate`,
`ShellContentBrowserClient`, and `ShellBrowserMainParts` (same 3-class chain as
Issue 620). `InitializeMessageLoopContext()` fires the `on_initialized`
callback. `ts_create_browser_context` creates a `ShellBrowserContext` with the
given path. `ts_create_tab` calls `Shell::CreateNewWindow`.

The macOS app bundle uses `shell_main_mac.cc` as its entry point (same as Issue
620 Experiments 1–3 and 8–11). The helper bundles also reuse Content Shell's
launcher unchanged.

#### Zig side

Create `browser/` in the main repo:

**`browser/build.zig`** — Build system. Produces a shared library (`.dylib`)
that the app bundle's `shell_main_mac.cc` loads via dlopen.

**`browser/src/main.zig`** — Zig entry point. Exports `ContentMain` as
`extern "C"` — this is the symbol that `shell_main_mac.cc` dlsym's. Inside, it:

1. Uses `std.DynLib` (or direct `@cImport` of `<dlfcn.h>`) to dlopen the
   Chromium framework (the C++ shim's shared library).
2. dlsym's `ts_set_on_initialized`, `ts_create_browser_context`,
   `ts_create_tab`.
3. Registers an `on_initialized` callback.
4. Calls the real `ContentMain` (dlsym'd from the framework).

The `on_initialized` callback:

1. Builds the profile path (`~/.config/termsurf/zig-profile-server/profile-a/`).
2. Calls `ts_create_browser_context(path)`.
3. Calls `ts_create_tab(ctx, "https://google.com")`.

#### Build

```bash
# Step 1: Build the C++ shim (framework + app bundle)
cd ~/dev/termsurf/chromium/src
export PATH="$HOME/dev/termsurf/chromium/depot_tools:$PATH"
autoninja -C out/Default zig_profile_server

# Step 2: Build the Zig shared library
cd ~/dev/termsurf/browser
zig build

# Step 3: Copy or symlink the Zig dylib into the framework bundle
# (exact mechanism TBD during implementation)
```

#### Verification

1. Run the app:
   ```bash
   open chromium/src/out/Default/Zig\ Profile\ Server.app
   ```
2. A Content Shell window appears showing google.com
3. The page is interactive (scrolling, clicking, typing work)
4. Profile directory created at
   `~/.config/termsurf/zig-profile-server/profile-a/`
5. Closing the window exits the process

If google.com loads in a Shell window, the Zig → C → C++ bridge works. The
Content API is successfully driven from Zig through the shim.

**Result:** Pass

Google.com loaded in a Shell window, fully interactive. The Zig binary dlopen'd
the framework, resolved all 6 symbols, registered callbacks, and drove
ContentMain successfully. The implementation differs from the design in two
minor ways:

1. The Zig binary replaces the app bundle's main executable directly (like Issue
   620 Experiment 4's `ts_main.mm`) rather than being a shared library loaded by
   `shell_main_mac.cc`. This is simpler — no intermediate dlopen layer.
2. The header exports 6 functions (ContentMain, set_on_initialized,
   set_on_shutdown, create_browser_context, destroy_browser_context, create_tab)
   rather than the 4 listed in the design. The shutdown callback and destroy
   function were added for clean lifecycle management.

#### Conclusion

The Zig-to-Chromium bridge works. A Zig `main()` can drive the entire Chromium
Content API through dlopen/dlsym with zero Chromium headers. The C++ shim is 3
new files on a vanilla Chromium tag — no Content Shell modifications. This
validates the architecture for the full Zig Profile Server rewrite.

### Experiment 2: Direct WebContents + CAContext ID

Prove that Zig can create a WebContents directly (no Shell window), set up a
persistent compositor for stable CAContext IDs, and receive the CAContext ID via
callback.

Experiment 1 used `ts_create_tab` which opens a Content Shell window with
chrome/toolbar. The production Zig Profile Server creates WebContents directly —
the GUI owns the windows, the profile server just reports CAContext IDs. This
experiment proves that pipeline.

#### Chromium side

Two commits on the `146.0.7650.0-issue-642` branch:

**Commit 1: `SetCALayerParamsCallback` on `RenderWidgetHostViewMac`.**

The same patch from Issue 625/633 (patch 0031), applied to the vanilla tag. Adds
a `CALayerParamsCallback` member and `SetCALayerParamsCallback()` method to
`RenderWidgetHostViewMac`. When the GPU process delivers new `CALayerParams`
(containing `ca_context_id`), the callback fires in
`AcceleratedWidgetCALayerParamsUpdated()`.

Files modified:

- `content/browser/renderer_host/render_widget_host_view_mac.h` — add include,
  callback type alias, method declaration, member variable
- `content/browser/renderer_host/render_widget_host_view_mac.mm` — implement
  `SetCALayerParamsCallback`, fire callback in
  `AcceleratedWidgetCALayerParamsUpdated`

**Commit 2: Extend C++ shim with direct WebContents creation.**

Five new exports added to `content_api_shim.h/.mm`:

```c
ts_web_contents_t ts_create_web_contents(ts_browser_context_t ctx,
                                         const char* url,
                                         int pixel_width, int pixel_height);
void ts_destroy_web_contents(ts_web_contents_t wc);
void ts_set_view_size(ts_web_contents_t wc, int pixel_width, int pixel_height);
typedef void (*ts_ca_context_callback_t)(ts_web_contents_t wc,
                                         unsigned int ca_context_id);
void ts_set_on_ca_context_id_changed(ts_ca_context_callback_t callback);
```

Implementation details:

- **Persistent compositor** (created once, on first `ts_create_web_contents`):
  `ui::AcceleratedWidgetMac` + `ui::Compositor` + `ui::Layer` (root,
  transparent). A `PersistentCompositorBridge` class implements
  `AcceleratedWidgetMacNSView`, receives
  `AcceleratedWidgetCALayerParamsUpdated`, extracts `ca_context_id`, and fires
  the Zig callback.
- **`ts_create_web_contents`**: creates `WebContents::Create(params)`, sets a
  minimal `WebContentsDelegate`, navigates via `LoadURLWithParams`, connects to
  the persistent compositor via `SetParentUiLayer(root_layer)`, registers
  `SetCALayerParamsCallback` on the view, calls `WasShown()`.
- **`ts_set_view_size`**: converts pixel→logical, calls `view->SetSize()`,
  updates persistent compositor bounds.
- All persistent objects are raw pointers (intentionally leaked — process
  lifetime). `PersistentCompositorBridge` is `final` to satisfy Chromium's
  `-Wdelete-non-abstract-non-virtual-dtor`.

New BUILD.gn deps: `//ui/accelerated_widget_mac`, `//ui/compositor`,
`//content/public/browser`.

#### Zig side

Updated `browser/src/main.zig`:

- New function pointer types: `CreateWebContentsFn`, `DestroyWebContentsFn`,
  `SetViewSizeFn`, `CAContextCallbackFn`, `SetOnCAContextChangedFn`
- `onInitialized` calls
  `ts_create_web_contents(ctx, "https://google.com", 1280, 720)` instead of
  `ts_create_tab`
- New `onCAContextChanged` callback prints `ca_context_id=N` to stderr
- `onShutdown` calls `ts_destroy_web_contents` before
  `ts_destroy_browser_context`

#### Build and test

```bash
cd chromium/src && autoninja -C out/Default zig_profile_server
cd browser && zig build
cp browser/zig-out/bin/zig_profile_server \
   "chromium/src/out/Default/Zig Profile Server.app/Contents/MacOS/Zig Profile Server"
codesign --force --deep -s - "chromium/src/out/Default/Zig Profile Server.app"
```

#### Issues encountered

1. **Exit-time destructors.** Chromium's `-Wexit-time-destructors` rejects
   `static std::unique_ptr<>` globals. Fixed by using raw pointers
   (intentionally leaked — these are process-lifetime objects).
2. **Non-virtual destructor on non-final class.** `PersistentCompositorBridge`
   inherits from `AcceleratedWidgetMacNSView` which has a non-virtual
   destructor. `std::unique_ptr::~unique_ptr` triggers
   `-Wdelete-non-abstract-non-virtual-dtor`. Fixed by marking the class `final`
   and removing `override` from the destructor.
3. **Storage service path conflict.** Using a different profile path
   (`profile-a`) than the default context (`default`) caused a FATAL crash in
   the storage service's filesystem proxy — it couldn't make `profile-a/` paths
   relative to `default/`. Fixed by using the same path for both contexts. This
   is fine for the experiment; production will handle multi-profile properly.
4. **Code signature invalidation.** Copying the Zig binary into the app bundle
   invalidates the code signature from `autoninja`. Fixed by re-codesigning:
   `codesign --force --deep -s -`.

#### Result: Pass

```
[ZigProfileServer] Created persistent compositor
[ZigProfileServer] Set parent_ui_layer_ on view
[ZigProfileServer] Created WebContents, navigating to https://google.com
ca_context_id=1704182908
```

All verification criteria met:

1. **No Shell window** — no Content Shell chrome/toolbar appeared
2. **`ca_context_id=1704182908`** — nonzero, printed to stderr by Zig callback
3. **No crash** — app stayed running, killed cleanly after 10 seconds
4. **Persistent compositor working** — GPU process rendering frames offscreen

#### Conclusion

Zig can create WebContents directly without Shell windows and receive stable
CAContext IDs from the persistent compositor. The GUI can use this ID with
`CALayerHost` to display the content — that integration happens in Stage 3
(XPC). The C++ shim grew from 3 exports (Experiment 1) to 8, still under 400
lines. The Zig launcher remains under 150 lines with zero Chromium headers.

### Experiment 3: XPC Gateway in Zig

Close the loop between the Zig Profile Server and the GUI. Experiments 1–2
proved standalone Chromium driving. This experiment makes the server receive
commands from the GUI via XPC and send back CAContext IDs — the production
communication pattern.

#### What changed

**`browser/build.zig.zon` (new):** Added `zig_objc` dependency (same URL/hash as
`gui/build.zig.zon`). XPC event handlers require ObjC blocks.

**`browser/build.zig` (modified):** Import `zig_objc` dependency, add `objc`
module to the executable's imports.

**`browser/src/main.zig` (rewritten):** Major rewrite from ~160 lines to ~290
lines. Changes:

- **Arg parsing:** `--xpc-service=<name>` and `--user-data-dir=<path>` from
  `std.os.argv`. If `--xpc-service` is absent, falls back to standalone mode
  (Experiment 2 behavior).
- **XPC extern declarations:** Full set of XPC C API functions and type
  constants, matching `gui/src/apprt/xpc.zig` pattern.
- **ObjC block type:** `EventBlock` via `objc.Block` from `zig_objc`.
- **`onInitialized` (XPC mode):** Creates BrowserContext at `--user-data-dir`,
  connects to XPC gateway via `xpc_connection_create_mach_service` (client
  mode), sends `server_register` with profile name (basename of data dir).
- **`xpcEventHandler`:** Dispatches on `action` field. `create_tab` extracts
  `url`, `pane_id`, `pixel_width`, `pixel_height`, calls
  `ts_create_web_contents`, stores `wc → pane_id` mapping. All other actions
  logged and ignored (later stages).
- **`onCAContextChanged`:** Looks up `pane_id` from `wc_to_pane` map, sends
  `{ action: "ca_context", pane_id, ca_context_id }` to gateway.
- **State:** `g_gateway` (XPC connection), `g_browser_ctx` (BrowserContext),
  `wc_to_pane[16]` (fixed-size tab mapping array).

**`gui/src/apprt/xpc.zig` (1-line change):** Updated `spawnServerProcess` to
launch `Zig Profile Server.app` instead of `Chromium Profile Server.app`.

#### No Chromium fork changes

The C++ shim from Experiments 1–2 is unchanged. The existing API is sufficient:
`ts_create_browser_context`, `ts_create_web_contents`,
`ts_destroy_web_contents`, `ts_set_on_ca_context_id_changed`,
`ts_set_on_initialized`, `ts_set_on_shutdown`.

#### Build

```bash
# C++ shim (no changes, but ensure it's built)
cd chromium/src && autoninja -C out/Default zig_profile_server

# Zig profile server
cd browser && zig build

# Replace executable + re-sign
cp browser/zig-out/bin/zig_profile_server \
   "chromium/src/out/Default/Zig Profile Server.app/Contents/MacOS/Zig Profile Server"
codesign --force --deep -s - "chromium/src/out/Default/Zig Profile Server.app"

# GUI
cd gui && zig build
```

#### Verification

1. `cd gui && zig build && open zig-out/TermSurf.app`
2. Type `web google.com` in a terminal pane
3. GUI spawns Zig Profile Server (`ps aux | grep zig_profile_server`)
4. Server logs: XPC connected, `server_register` sent
5. GUI logs: `server_register` received, `create_tab` sent
6. Server logs: `create_tab` received, WebContents created
7. Server sends `ca_context` → GUI creates CALayerHost
8. **Google.com renders in the terminal pane**
9. Page is NOT interactive (no mouse/keyboard — that's Stage 4)

#### Result: Fail

The Zig code compiled and both `browser/` and `gui/` built cleanly. The GUI
successfully spawned the Zig Profile Server process and its Dock icon appeared.
However, the server crashed immediately on launch with a code signing error
before any Zig code executed.

**Crash diagnosis:**

The crash reports
(`~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/Zig Profile Server-2026-02-25-*.ips`) show:

```
"exception": {
  "type": "EXC_BAD_ACCESS",
  "signal": "SIGKILL (Code Signature Invalid)",
  "subtype": "UNKNOWN_0x32 at 0x0000000100eb0000"
}
"termination": {
  "namespace": "CODESIGNING",
  "indicator": "Invalid Page"
}
```

The process dies in dyld during `mach_o::Header::isMachO` — before any
application code runs. The macOS kernel kills it because the code signature on
the binary's pages doesn't satisfy the validation required for the launch
context.

**The paradox:** The same binary works fine when launched directly from the
terminal (`./Zig Profile Server --xpc-service=... --user-data-dir=...`). It
successfully connects to the XPC gateway, creates a BrowserContext, and sends
`server_register`. The code signing also verifies correctly with
`codesign -vv --deep` (both the binary and the full `.app` bundle pass).

The crash only occurs when the GUI spawns the server via `std.process.Child`
(which uses `posix_spawn`). The Chromium Profile Server (the old C++ binary
built by `autoninja`) does not have this problem when spawned the same way.

**Likely cause:** The Zig-built binary's ad-hoc signature (`flags=0x2(adhoc)`)
differs from the Chromium-built binary's signature in a way that macOS code
signing enforcement rejects when the process is spawned as a child of a signed
app bundle. The `codesign --force --deep -s -` re-signing may not produce a
signature that satisfies the kernel's page validation for binaries within
Chromium's app bundle structure (which includes Helper apps with their own
entitlements and designated requirements).

**What needs investigation for the next experiment:**

- Compare the code signing flags/entitlements between the old
  `chromium_profile_server` binary and the new `zig_profile_server` binary
- Check whether the Zig binary needs specific entitlements
  (`com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation`,
  `com.apple.security.cs.allow-unsigned-executable-memory`, etc.)
- Check whether the Helper app bundles inside `Zig Profile Server.app` have
  designated requirements that conflict with the ad-hoc-signed main executable
- Try signing with the same entitlements as the original Chromium build

### Experiment 4: Code Signing Research

Experiment 3 failed because macOS killed the Zig binary with
`SIGKILL (Code Signature Invalid)` when spawned by the GUI, even though the same
binary works from the terminal. This experiment is pure research — compare the
code signing properties of the working Chromium-built binary against the failing
Zig replacement to identify what's different.

#### Steps

1. **Dump full code signing details for both main executables:**

   ```bash
   codesign -dvvv "chromium/src/out/Default/Chromium Profile Server.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium Profile Server" 2>&1
   codesign -dvvv "chromium/src/out/Default/Zig Profile Server.app/Contents/MacOS/Zig Profile Server" 2>&1
   ```

   Compare: `Identifier`, `Format`, `CodeDirectory` flags, `Hash type`,
   `Signature` type (adhoc vs real), `Sealed Resources`,
   `Internal requirements`.

2. **Dump entitlements for both main executables:**

   ```bash
   codesign --display --entitlements - "chromium/src/out/Default/Chromium Profile Server.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium Profile Server" 2>&1
   codesign --display --entitlements - "chromium/src/out/Default/Zig Profile Server.app/Contents/MacOS/Zig Profile Server" 2>&1
   ```

   Key entitlements to look for:
   `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation`,
   `com.apple.security.cs.allow-unsigned-executable-memory`,
   `com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit`,
   `com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables`.

3. **Check the Info.plist for both apps:**

   ```bash
   diff <(plutil -p "chromium/src/out/Default/Chromium Profile Server.app/Contents/Info.plist") \
        <(plutil -p "chromium/src/out/Default/Zig Profile Server.app/Contents/Info.plist")
   ```

   The `Zig Profile Server.app` Info.plist was created by `autoninja` for the
   original Chromium binary. Check if it references the original binary name or
   has signing-related keys.

4. **Check Helper app designated requirements:**

   ```bash
   codesign -d --requirements - "chromium/src/out/Default/Zig Profile Server.app/Contents/Frameworks/Zig Profile Server Helper.app" 2>&1
   codesign -d --requirements - "chromium/src/out/Default/Zig Profile Server.app/Contents/Frameworks/Zig Profile Server Helper (GPU).app" 2>&1
   ```

   Helper apps may have designated requirements that reference the main
   executable's signing identity. If the main binary's signature doesn't match,
   macOS may reject the entire bundle.

5. **Check whether Chromium's build signs with `--options runtime`:**

   The Hardened Runtime flag (`runtime`) enables stricter code signing
   enforcement. If the original was signed with it and our re-signing doesn't
   include it, or vice versa, that could explain the difference.

   ```bash
   codesign -dvvv "chromium/src/out/Default/Chromium Profile Server.app" 2>&1 | grep -i flag
   codesign -dvvv "chromium/src/out/Default/Zig Profile Server.app" 2>&1 | grep -i flag
   ```

#### Expected outcome

A clear list of differences between the two signing profiles. From that, we can
determine exactly which flags/entitlements to use when re-signing the Zig binary
in Experiment 5.

#### Result: Pass

The research identified the root cause. The two binaries have fundamentally
different signing profiles:

| Property             | Original (Chromium-built)      | Zig replacement              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **flags**            | `0x20002(adhoc,linker-signed)` | `0x2(adhoc)`                 |
| **hashes**           | `9+0`                          | `77+3`                       |
| **Info.plist**       | `not bound`                    | `entries=18`                 |
| **Sealed Resources** | `none`                         | `version=2 rules=13 files=3` |
| **Internal reqs**    | `none`                         | `count=0 size=12`            |
| **Entitlements**     | none                           | none                         |

**Root cause: `linker-signed` vs full adhoc signature.**

The original Chromium binary has `linker-signed` (`0x20000`) — a lightweight
signature embedded by `ld64` at link time. It has no sealed resources, no bound
Info.plist, no internal requirements. It's the minimal signature macOS requires
for arm64 binaries.

When we ran `codesign --force --deep -s -` on the Zig Profile Server app bundle,
it replaced the Zig binary's signature with a **full adhoc signature** that
seals the Info.plist and Resources into the code directory. This creates a
mismatch — the sealed resources reference the original bundle structure, but the
main binary was swapped from the Chromium-built one to the Zig-built one. The
page hashes in the code directory no longer match the actual binary pages.

Additionally, `--deep` re-signs all nested bundles recursively, potentially
corrupting the framework's existing signatures from `autoninja`.

**Other differences (not the cause):**

- No entitlements on either binary.
- No Hardened Runtime on either binary.
- No Helper app bundles — both use a framework bundle instead.
- Info.plist differences are cosmetic (display names, version strings). The
  original also has `LSUIElement=true` (Dock hiding) which the Zig app lacks.

**Fix for Experiment 5:** Don't use `codesign --force --deep -s -`. Instead,
sign only the main binary without sealing resources:

```bash
codesign --force -s - \
  "chromium/src/out/Default/Zig Profile Server.app/Contents/MacOS/Zig Profile Server"
```

This signs just the executable (replacing its linker signature with an adhoc
signature that has correct page hashes) without touching the framework or
sealing bundle resources. The framework retains its original `autoninja`
signature.

### Experiment 5: `zig build` Assembles the App Bundle

Experiment 4 showed the code signing crash was caused by Frankensteining two
build systems' outputs together — copying the Zig binary into a Chromium-built
`.app` bundle, then re-signing with `codesign --deep`, which sealed mismatched
resources and corrupted the framework's signature.

The fix: `zig build` assembles the complete `.app` bundle itself. The Chromium
build (`autoninja`) produces only the framework. `zig build` takes the framework
and wraps it in a proper app bundle with the Zig executable. No post-build copy,
no `codesign`. The Zig linker produces a valid `linker-signed` binary, and the
framework keeps its `autoninja` signature.

#### Current app bundle structure

```
Zig Profile Server.app/
├── Contents/
│   ├── Info.plist
│   ├── PkgInfo
│   ├── MacOS/
│   │   └── Zig Profile Server          ← Zig binary (replace this)
│   ├── Frameworks/
│   │   └── Zig Profile Server Framework.framework/  ← 120MB, from autoninja
│   │       ├── Zig Profile Server Framework         ← main dylib
│   │       ├── Helpers/                             ← GPU, Renderer, Plugin
│   │       ├── Libraries/                           ← component dylibs
│   │       └── Resources/                           ← pak files, locales, etc.
│   └── Resources/
│       └── app.icns
```

`autoninja` builds the entire bundle today. We only need it to build the
framework. The outer `.app` shell (Info.plist, PkgInfo, MacOS/) comes from
`zig build`.

#### What to change

**`browser/build.zig`:**

After building the `zig_profile_server` executable, add install steps that
assemble the `.app` bundle:

1. Install the Zig executable to
   `Zig Profile Server.app/Contents/MacOS/Zig Profile Server`
2. Write `Info.plist` (hardcoded — it's 18 keys, rarely changes)
3. Write `PkgInfo` (literally `APPL????`)
4. Symlink the framework from `chromium/src/out/Default/` into
   `Zig Profile Server.app/Contents/Frameworks/`

The framework symlink avoids copying 120MB on every build. The framework only
changes when the C++ shim changes (rare). The symlink also means `autoninja`
output is used in-place — no signature invalidation.

**Key detail — framework path:** The Zig binary resolves the framework at
runtime via `@executable_path/../Frameworks/`. The rpath is already set in
`build.zig` (`@executable_path/../Frameworks`). The symlink makes this work.

**`browser/src/main.zig`:** No changes needed. The binary already uses
`_NSGetExecutablePath` + `dirname` to find `../Frameworks/`.

**`gui/src/apprt/xpc.zig`:** Update `spawnServerProcess` to point at the new
bundle location. The bundle now lives at `browser/zig-out/` instead of
`chromium/src/out/Default/`.

#### Info.plist contents

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"
  "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>CFBundleDevelopmentRegion</key><string>en</string>
  <key>CFBundleDisplayName</key><string>Zig Profile Server</string>
  <key>CFBundleExecutable</key><string>Zig Profile Server</string>
  <key>CFBundleIdentifier</key><string>com.termsurf.zig-profile-server</string>
  <key>CFBundleInfoDictionaryVersion</key><string>6.0</string>
  <key>CFBundleName</key><string>Zig Profile Server</string>
  <key>CFBundlePackageType</key><string>APPL</string>
  <key>CFBundleShortVersionString</key><string>1.0.0</string>

  <key>LSUIElement</key><true/>
  <key>NSPrincipalClass</key><string>NSApplication</string>
  <key>NSSupportsAutomaticGraphicsSwitching</key><true/>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Note: `LSUIElement=true` hides the Dock icon (the original Chromium-built app
had this; the Zig app was missing it — that's why the Dock icon appeared in
Experiment 3).

#### Build workflow

```bash
# Once (or after C++ shim changes):
cd chromium/src && autoninja -C out/Default zig_profile_server

# Every time Zig code changes:
cd browser && zig build

# Launch:
cd gui && zig build && open zig-out/TermSurf.app
# Then type: web google.com
```

No `cp`. No `codesign`. `zig build` produces a complete, launchable `.app`.

#### Verification

Same as Experiment 3, plus:

1. No code signing crash — server stays alive
2. No Dock icon (LSUIElement=true)
3. `codesign -dvvv` on the main binary shows `linker-signed` (Zig's linker)
4. `codesign -dvvv` on the framework shows the original `autoninja` signature

#### Result: Fail

Two separate failures encountered:

**Failure 1: Symlink approach — `GetContentsPath` DCHECK.**

The initial implementation used a symlink for the framework. Chromium's
`content/shell/app/paths_apple.mm:GetContentsPath()` calls `realpath()` on the
executable path, which resolves symlinks to the actual filesystem location.
After navigating up 2 directory levels, the basename wasn't "Contents" — it was
somewhere in the chromium build tree.
`DCHECK_EQ("Contents", path.BaseName().value())` fired, causing `SIGABRT`.

Fixed by copying the framework instead of symlinking. The 120MB copy is
acceptable since it only happens when the C++ shim changes.

**Failure 2: Copy approach — server crashes or hangs, GUI unresponsive.**

After switching to a real framework copy, the code signing crash was resolved
(no more `SIGKILL`). But the server still failed to work end-to-end. Typing
`web google.com` in the terminal pane produced no web page, all keybindings were
lost, and the app had to be force-killed.

The crash reports show `SIGABRT` from `GetContentsPath()` — the same DCHECK. The
framework copy preserves the internal directory structure, but Chromium's path
resolution still doesn't find "Contents" at the expected level. The `realpath()`
call resolves the executable path through the copied framework's internal
structure rather than the outer app bundle's `Contents/` directory.

**Root cause:** Chromium's `GetContentsPath()` assumes a specific bundle layout
where the executable lives at `*.app/Contents/MacOS/<name>` and navigating up 2
levels from the executable reaches `Contents/`. This works for the
Chromium-built bundle because `autoninja` creates the entire bundle structure
consistently. When `zig build` assembles the bundle with a copied framework, the
internal paths are correct, but the crash report suggests the DCHECK is still
failing — possibly because the framework's Helper apps resolve their own paths
relative to the framework's original location.

**Conclusion:** Assembling the app bundle from `zig build` requires deeper
understanding of Chromium's bundle path expectations. The next experiment should
investigate whether the issue is in the main process or the Helper subprocess
launch, and whether the Chromium-built outer `.app` shell (from `autoninja`)
needs to be preserved while only replacing the main executable.

### Experiments 3–5 Conclusion

Three experiments attempted to connect the Zig Profile Server to the GUI via
XPC. All failed. The Zig XPC code itself was never the problem — the code
compiled, the XPC message dispatch logic was sound, and when the server was
launched manually from the terminal it connected to the gateway, created a
BrowserContext, and sent `server_register` successfully. The failures were all
in the deployment pipeline: getting the Zig binary to run inside a Chromium app
bundle when spawned by the GUI.

#### What worked

- **Zig XPC code.** The `objc.Block`-based event handler, arg parsing,
  `xpc_connection_create_mach_service` client connection, `server_register` /
  `ca_context` message format — all correct. Verified by launching the server
  directly from the terminal in Experiment 5.
- **`zig_objc` integration.** Adding the dependency to `browser/build.zig.zon`
  and importing the `objc` module worked without issues.
- **App bundle assembly from `zig build`.** The build system correctly produces
  a `.app` bundle with Info.plist, PkgInfo, executable, and framework.

#### What failed

1. **Experiment 3: Code signing.** Copying the Zig binary into the
   Chromium-built `.app` bundle and re-signing with
   `codesign --force --deep -s -` produced a full adhoc signature that sealed
   mismatched resources. The original Chromium binary had `linker-signed`
   (lightweight, no sealed resources). macOS killed the process with
   `SIGKILL (Code Signature Invalid)` before any code ran.

2. **Experiment 5, attempt 1: Symlink.** Symlinking the framework from the
   Zig-assembled bundle to the Chromium build output broke Chromium's
   `GetContentsPath()`, which calls `realpath()` to resolve the executable path.
   `realpath()` follows symlinks, so the resolved path pointed into the Chromium
   build tree instead of the app bundle's `Contents/` directory. `DCHECK` crash.

3. **Experiment 5, attempt 2: Copy.** Copying the framework instead of
   symlinking avoided the `realpath()` symlink issue, but the server still
   crashed or hung. The `GetContentsPath()` DCHECK continued to fail — the
   Chromium framework has deep assumptions about the bundle layout that extend
   beyond just the main executable location.

#### Root cause

Chromium's macOS bundle path resolution is tightly coupled to the exact
directory structure that `autoninja` produces. The code in
`content/shell/app/paths_apple.mm` navigates the directory hierarchy by counting
levels (`path.DirName().DirName()`) and asserts the result. Any deviation from
the expected layout — different signing, symlinks, reconstructed bundles —
triggers fatal assertions.

The fundamental mistake was trying to replace or reconstruct the app bundle.
Chromium builds are not composable — you can't swap parts in and out.

#### Lessons for next time

1. **Don't fight the Chromium build system.** The app bundle must come from
   `autoninja`. The Zig binary must be placed inside that bundle, not the other
   way around. The Experiment 2 workflow (copy Zig binary in, re-sign) was the
   right direction — the signing just needed to be done correctly.

2. **Iterate on one variable at a time.** Experiment 3 changed two things at
   once: added XPC code AND changed the deployment pipeline. When it failed, it
   was unclear which change caused the failure. The XPC code should have been
   tested with the known-working Experiment 2 deployment first.

3. **Test deployment before logic.** The correct sequence: (a) copy the
   Experiment 2 Zig binary into the autoninja bundle with correct signing,
   verify it launches when spawned by the GUI, (b) then add XPC code.

4. **Sign only the binary, not the bundle.** Experiment 4 showed the fix:
   `codesign --force -s - <binary>` (not `--deep`, not the `.app`). This signs
   just the executable with correct page hashes without touching the framework
   or sealing bundle resources. This was never tested because Experiment 5 went
   in a different direction (zig build assembly).

5. **Keep the code.** The XPC implementation in `browser/src/main.zig` is
   correct and reusable. The `build.zig.zon` and `objc` module setup is correct.
   Only the deployment pipeline needs to change.

## Conclusion

Issue 642 set out to rewrite the Chromium Profile Server in Zig across 7 planned
stages. Experiments 1–2 succeeded: Zig can dlopen the Chromium framework, drive
ContentMain, create WebContents directly without Shell windows, and receive
stable CAContext IDs from the persistent compositor. The Zig-to-Chromium bridge
works.

Experiments 3–5 attempted Stage 3 (XPC gateway) and failed — not because of the
Zig code, but because of macOS app bundle deployment. Three different approaches
to getting the Zig binary into a launchable Chromium app bundle all hit
different walls: code signing invalidation, symlink resolution via `realpath()`,
and Chromium's hardcoded bundle path assertions.

Issue 643 continued the effort with a new approach: move the Zig code into
`chromium/src/` and build it with `autoninja` via a GN `action()`. This solved
the deployment problem — Experiment 643-1 produced a working standalone app
bundle in a single build command, with correct `linker-signed` code signing. But
Experiment 643-2 (XPC gateway) still failed. The server spawns, Chromium
initializes, but no web page renders.

Across both issues: 7 experiments, and the Zig Profile Server never achieved
end-to-end XPC integration. Standalone Chromium works every time (642-1, 642-2,
643-1), but the XPC pipeline from GUI → Zig server → web content in the terminal
pane has never worked. The existing C++ profile server handles all of this
correctly. A different approach is needed.
