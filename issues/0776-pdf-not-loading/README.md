# Issue 776: PDF files show blank white screen instead of rendering

## Goal

Opening a local PDF file via `web file.pdf` should render the PDF content, not a
blank white screen.

## Background

When a user runs `web file.pdf` (or any local PDF path), the browser pane opens
but displays a blank white screen instead of rendering the PDF. The navigation
appears to work (no error is shown), but no PDF content is visible.

Chromium normally has a built-in PDF viewer (PDFium) that renders PDFs inline.
The blank screen suggests either:

1. The PDF viewer plugin is not enabled or not included in the Chromium
   build/configuration used by Roamium.
2. The `file://` URL scheme is not being handled correctly for PDF MIME types.
3. The PDF viewer requires UI chrome (toolbar, scroll handling) that isn't
   available in the embedded context.
4. Content Security Policy or sandboxing restrictions are blocking the PDF
   plugin from loading.

## Analysis

Possible areas to investigate:

- **Chromium PDF plugin registration** — Check whether `libtermsurf_chromium`
  enables the PDF viewer plugin (`chrome_pdf`) during browser initialization.
  Headless or minimal embeddings often skip plugin registration.
- **MIME type handling** — Verify that `file://` URLs with `.pdf` extension are
  being served with `application/pdf` MIME type and routed to the PDF viewer.
- **Plugin process sandboxing** — The PDF viewer runs in a utility process;
  sandbox restrictions in the TermSurf build may prevent it from launching.
- **Alternative approach** — If enabling the built-in viewer is complex,
  consider whether PDF.js (Mozilla's JavaScript PDF renderer) could work as a
  fallback.

## Experiments

### Experiment 1: Probe Chromium PDF Viewer Plumbing

#### Description

The likely cause is not `webtui` path handling. TermSurf's Chromium embedder is
built on Content Shell, and Content Shell does not wire Chromium's PDF viewer
pipeline. Electron's embedder shows the required pieces explicitly:

- PDF build deps and resources;
- PDF plugin registration through `ContentClient::AddPlugins()`;
- PDF component-extension/resource loading;
- PDF stream routing for the PDF viewer;
- renderer-side creation of the internal PDF plugin with
  `pdf::CreateInternalPlugin()`.

TermSurf currently overrides only `CreateContentBrowserClient()` in
`TsMainDelegate`. It does not provide a TermSurf `ContentClient`, does not
provide a TermSurf renderer client, and `libtermsurf_chromium/BUILD.gn` has no
PDF deps. Therefore the PDF navigation can succeed while no viewer exists to
render the document.

This experiment is a scoped PDF-rendering probe with automated screenshot
capture and agent visual triage. It should add the smallest TermSurf
`ContentClient` / renderer-client hooks needed to make Chromium's built-in PDF
path available, then run TermSurf end-to-end and take a screenshot of a real PDF
loaded in the browser pane.

The primary question for this experiment is user-visible:

```text
Does the PDF visibly render in the TermSurf browser pane?
```

The experiment should not require manual app interaction for verification. It
will capture screenshots automatically, then the agent will inspect those
artifacts visually. The screenshot script does not need to implement OCR or
image classification; it only needs to produce deterministic artifacts. If a
screenshot shows recognizable PDF content, the experiment passes. If the
screenshot is still blank or white, the result should record the artifact and
only then use logs to decide the next experiment.

Use the vendored Bitcoin whitepaper fixture:

```text
test-html/public/bitcoin.pdf
```

The primary automated run should open it through the local test server:

```text
http://localhost:9616/bitcoin.pdf
```

That avoids network flakiness while still exercising Chromium's browser PDF
rendering path. If the HTTP fixture renders, also run a second screenshot check
against the same file through `file://` to verify the original local-file goal:

```text
file:///Users/ryan/dev/termsurf/test-html/public/bitcoin.pdf
```

This experiment commits to the expensive product direction: in-pane PDF viewing
inside the TermSurf browser overlay. A simpler fallback would be to hand PDFs to
macOS Preview or another external viewer, but that breaks the in-terminal
experience. If the Chromium pipeline proves far larger than expected in later
experiments, that product trade-off can be revisited explicitly.

#### Changes

1. Precondition checks:
   - Verify the current Chromium GN args do not disable PDF/plugin/extension
     support:
     ```bash
     cd chromium/src
     gn args out/Default --list | rg 'enable_pdf|enable_extensions|enable_plugins'
     ```
     Expected: `enable_pdf`, `enable_extensions`, and `enable_plugins` are
     enabled under defaults or are not overridden to `false`.
   - After adding the minimal PDF deps, run
     `gn check out/Default //content/libtermsurf_chromium`. `testonly = true` is
     not expected to block the listed deps; if GN proves otherwise, stop and
     record the exact dependency error instead of silently changing the target's
     test-only status.
2. Create a new Chromium branch for this issue:
   - start from the most relevant current branch, currently
     `148.0.7778.97-issue-778`;
   - create `148.0.7778.97-issue-776`;
   - add it to the Branches table in `chromium/README.md`.
3. Update `chromium/src/content/libtermsurf_chromium/BUILD.gn` to include only
   the minimal PDF deps needed for this plumbing probe:
   - `//pdf`;
   - `//pdf:features`;
   - `//components/pdf/common:constants`;
   - `//components/pdf/common:util`;
   - `//components/pdf/renderer`. Do not add `//components/pdf/browser`,
     extension, MimeHandlerView, or stream-manager deps in this experiment
     unless a compile error proves one of them is needed by the plumbing probe
     itself.

   Do not include `//chrome/browser/resources/pdf:resources` in the first build
   attempt. If the plugin is created but the screenshot remains blank, record
   "plugin created, viewer resources or MimeHandlerView missing" as an expected
   Partial outcome. A compile error is not expected to reveal this runtime
   missing-resource layer.

4. Add a TermSurf content client, for example `ts_content_client.{cc,h}`,
   derived from `ShellContentClient`.
   - Override `AddPlugins()`.
   - Register the internal PDF plugin using the Chrome/Electron pattern:
     `pdf::kInternalPluginMimeType`, extension `"pdf"`, description
     `"Portable Document Format"`, and
     `content::WebPluginInfo::PLUGIN_TYPE_BROWSER_INTERNAL_PLUGIN`.
   - Keep all existing `ShellContentClient` behavior by inheriting from it.
   - Add a temporary `LOG(INFO)` line confirming PDF plugin registration.
5. Update `TsMainDelegate` to override `CreateContentClient()` and return the
   new TermSurf content client.
6. Add a TermSurf renderer client, for example `ts_renderer_client.{cc,h}`,
   derived from `ShellContentRendererClient`.
   - Override `OverrideCreatePlugin()`.
   - First preserve the existing Shell behavior, including surface-embed plugin
     handling.
   - If `params.mime_type.Utf8() == pdf::kInternalPluginMimeType`, call
     `pdf::CreateInternalPlugin(std::move(params), render_frame, {})`.
   - Return `true` only when a plugin was actually created. If PDF creation
     returns `nullptr`, let the normal Shell fallback continue or fail visibly;
     do not silently synthesize a blank page.
   - Add temporary `LOG(INFO)` lines that report each PDF MIME type seen by
     `OverrideCreatePlugin()` and whether `pdf::CreateInternalPlugin()` returned
     a plugin or `nullptr`.
7. Override `IsPluginHandledExternally()` in the TermSurf renderer client.
   - Log when `mime_type == pdf::kPDFMimeType` or
     `pdf::kInternalPluginMimeType`.
   - Do not try to implement MimeHandlerView in this experiment.
   - The method exists on Chromium 148's `ContentRendererClient`; implement the
     override directly. If the implementation reveals that useful behavior
     requires broad extensions infrastructure, record that explicitly in the
     result instead of silently widening scope.
8. Update `TsMainDelegate` to override `CreateContentRendererClient()` and
   return the new TermSurf renderer client.
9. Do not wire the PDF component-extension, MimeHandlerView, GuestView, or
   streams-private path in this experiment. Instead, document them as the likely
   next layer if plugin registration succeeds but PDFs still do not render. The
   future implementation should be based on Electron's:
   - `shell/browser/extensions/electron_extension_system.cc`;
   - `shell/browser/extensions/electron_component_extension_resource_manager.cc`;
   - `shell/browser/extensions/api/streams_private/streams_private_api.cc`;
   - Chromium patch equivalent for redirecting
     `plugin_response_interceptor_url_loader_throttle.cc` to the embedder's
     streams-private implementation.
10. Do not change:
    - `webtui`;
    - Roamium's Rust IPC;
    - `termsurf.proto`;
    - Wezboard overlay positioning or input forwarding.

11. Build `libtermsurf_chromium` with `autoninja`, rebuild Roamium against the
    new library, and run the diagnostic verification. Regenerate and commit the
    Issue 776 Chromium patch archive on Pass or Partial. Skip archiving only for
    a Fail result that leaves the Chromium branch in an incoherent state, and
    document why the archive was skipped.

12. Add an automated visual PDF smoke-test command or script.

    The automation should:
    - create an isolated log/state directory under `logs/issue-776-exp1-*`;
    - launch debug Wezboard directly from `wezboard/target/debug/wezboard-gui`;
    - launch debug `webtui/target/debug/web` inside that Wezboard session using
      the repo-built Roamium binary:

      ```text
      /Users/ryan/dev/termsurf/chromium/src/out/Default/roamium
      ```

    - ensure the local test server is running and serves
      `test-html/public/bitcoin.pdf`;
    - open:

      ```text
      http://localhost:9616/bitcoin.pdf
      ```

    - wait for the browser pane to settle;
    - capture a macOS screenshot with `screencapture`;
    - save the screenshot under `logs/issue-776-exp1-*`;
    - print the screenshot path and any relevant log paths.

    Prefer a direct startup-command or command-line launch path if Wezboard
    exposes one, because it avoids keyboard focus flakiness. If no reliable
    direct launch path exists, the automation may use macOS GUI automation, such
    as AppleScript/System Events, to type the debug `web` command into the newly
    launched Wezboard window. This is acceptable for this experiment because the
    target is an end-to-end visual smoke test of the actual GUI path.

    If AppleScript/System Events are used, Accessibility permission is also a
    precondition. Screen Recording permission is required for `screencapture`;
    Accessibility permission is required for typed GUI automation.

    The automation must not rely on installed stable TermSurf binaries. It must
    use debug Wezboard, debug `web`, and the repo-built Roamium/Chromium path.

#### Non-Negotiable Invariants

- Local PDF rendering is fixed in Chromium/Roamium, not by special-casing PDF
  paths in `webtui`.
- Normal HTML navigation, local file navigation, link clicks, scrolling, and
  keyboard input remain unchanged.
- The fix must not introduce a second browser surface or a separate native
  window for PDFs; PDFs should render in the existing browser overlay.
- The PDF viewer must not require changes to the TermSurf protobuf protocol.
- The implementation must preserve Content Shell behavior unrelated to PDFs.
- Experiment 1 must not quietly grow into an extensions/MimeHandlerView port. If
  that layer is required, stop with a Partial result and design Experiment 2
  around it.
- The Chromium changes must live on the `148.0.7778.97-issue-776` branch. On
  Pass or Partial, they must be archived under `chromium/patches/issue-776/`. On
  an incoherent Fail, the result must explain why archiving was skipped.

#### Verification

This experiment's verification uses automated capture plus agent visual triage.
Manual inspection by the user is not required to decide whether the experiment
passes. The automation produces screenshots and logs; the agent classifies the
artifact by visual inspection.

1. Confirm screenshot capture is available before running the full test:

   ```bash
   screencapture -x /private/tmp/termsurf-screenshot-permission-test.png
   test -s /private/tmp/termsurf-screenshot-permission-test.png
   ```

   If this fails, stop and record the permission problem. The experiment cannot
   be visually verified until macOS Screen Recording permission is granted to
   the process running the test.

   If the automation uses AppleScript/System Events to type into Wezboard,
   verify Accessibility permission as well. If Accessibility permission is not
   available, either use a non-typed launch path or stop and record the
   automation permission problem.

2. Record the precondition results:
   - `enable_pdf`, `enable_extensions`, and `enable_plugins` state;
   - whether `gn check out/Default //content/libtermsurf_chromium` passes after
     the minimal deps are added.

3. Build Chromium:

   ```bash
   cd chromium/src
   export PATH="$(cd ../depot_tools && pwd):$PATH"
   autoninja -C out/Default libtermsurf_chromium
   ```

4. Build Wezboard, Roamium, and webtui in debug mode:

   ```bash
   cd /Users/ryan/dev/termsurf
   ./scripts/build.sh wezboard
   ./scripts/build.sh roamium
   ./scripts/build.sh webtui
   ```

5. Run the automated visual PDF smoke test.

   Start the local test server if it is not already running. The fixture is:

   ```text
   /Users/ryan/dev/termsurf/test-html/public/bitcoin.pdf
   ```

   The test must launch debug Wezboard and debug `web`, explicitly passing the
   repo-built Roamium binary:

   ```bash
   /Users/ryan/dev/termsurf/webtui/target/debug/web \
     --browser /Users/ryan/dev/termsurf/chromium/src/out/Default/roamium \
     http://localhost:9616/bitcoin.pdf
   ```

   The test then waits for load and captures a screenshot.

6. If the HTTP fixture renders, run a second screenshot check against the local
   file URL:

   ```bash
   /Users/ryan/dev/termsurf/webtui/target/debug/web \
     --browser /Users/ryan/dev/termsurf/chromium/src/out/Default/roamium \
     file:///Users/ryan/dev/termsurf/test-html/public/bitcoin.pdf
   ```

   This verifies the original `web file.pdf` class of bug after the renderer
   path is proven to work.

7. Inspect the screenshot artifacts.

   The automated result should classify the screenshot as one of:
   - **rendered PDF** — visible Bitcoin whitepaper content is present, such as
     the title `Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System`, author text, or
     body paragraphs;
   - **blank/white** — the browser pane is blank or shows a white PDF surface
     without recognizable document content;
   - **navigation/error page** — TermSurf reached an error page, network error,
     or non-PDF page instead of the PDF;
   - **automation failure** — Wezboard, `web`, Roamium, network access, or
     screenshot capture failed before the visual state could be determined.

   A human-readable screenshot path must be recorded in the experiment result.

8. If and only if the screenshot is blank/white or an error page, collect the
   logs and record a failure-layer table:

   | Layer                                                       | Result                 |
   | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
   | PDF build flags enabled                                     | yes/no                 |
   | Minimal PDF deps compile                                    | yes/no                 |
   | PDF plugin registered in `AddPlugins()`                     | yes/no                 |
   | `OverrideCreatePlugin()` sees internal PDF MIME type        | yes/no                 |
   | `CreateInternalPlugin()` returns a plugin                   | yes/no/null-not-called |
   | `IsPluginHandledExternally()` sees top-level PDF            | yes/no                 |
   | Plugin created but viewer resources/MimeHandlerView missing | yes/no                 |
   | Evidence that MimeHandlerView/extension layer is next       | yes/no                 |
   | Evidence that PDF stream routing is next                    | yes/no                 |
   | Evidence that plugin/utility sandboxing is next             | yes/no                 |

   Copy this table into the result with concrete `yes`, `no`, or
   `null-not-called` values instead of reconstructing the diagnosis from memory
   after the run.

#### Pass Criteria

The automated screenshot for the local HTTP fixture shows recognizable Bitcoin
PDF content rendered inside the existing TermSurf browser overlay.

The pass decision is visual. It does not require proving every PDF plumbing
layer, and it does not require manual interaction beyond granting screenshot and
automation permissions before the run.

If the HTTP fixture renders but the `file://` fixture does not, the experiment
still passes for browser PDF rendering and should open a follow-up focused on
local-file MIME/path handling.

#### Partial Criteria

The screenshot is still blank/white or reaches an error page, but the automated
run succeeds and logs identify the first missing layer in dependency order:

1. PDF build flags/deps;
2. plugin registration;
3. renderer plugin creation;
4. top-level PDF external plugin handling;
5. MimeHandlerView/extension infrastructure;
6. PDF stream routing.

If multiple layers are missing, the next experiment should target the earliest
missing layer in this list.

#### Failure Criteria

- The automated test cannot launch the correct debug Wezboard/debug `web`/repo
  Roamium path.
- The automated test uses installed stable TermSurf binaries instead of repo
  debug binaries.
- Screenshot capture fails after permission has been granted.
- The experiment makes PDFs blank or crashes without producing a screenshot or
  enough logs to identify the first missing layer.
- The fix only handles PDFs by opening an external app or native window.
- The fix adds PDF-specific behavior to `webtui` while the Chromium viewer
  remains unwired.
- Normal HTML or local file navigation regresses.
- Roamium crashes when opening a PDF.
- The experiment quietly starts porting the extension/MimeHandlerView stack
  instead of stopping at the scoped plumbing probe.

**Result:** Partial

Experiment 1 implemented the scoped Chromium PDF plumbing probe and automated
visual smoke test. The Chromium branch `148.0.7778.97-issue-776` now adds a
TermSurf `ContentClient`, registers the internal Chromium PDF plugin, adds a
TermSurf renderer client, and logs PDF-related renderer hooks. The automation
script `scripts/test-issue-776-pdf.sh` launches debug Wezboard, debug `web`, and
the repo-built Roamium binary, then captures a screenshot of the vendored
Bitcoin PDF served by the local test server.

The automated run succeeded, but the PDF did not render. Screenshot artifact:

```text
/Users/ryan/dev/termsurf/logs/issue-776-exp1-20260527-075821/pdf-smoke.png
```

Visual classification: `blank/white`. The browser pane reached
`http://localhost:9616/bitcoin.pdf`, but no recognizable Bitcoin whitepaper
content appeared.

Build and verification notes:

- `autoninja -C out/Default libtermsurf_chromium` succeeded after adding the
  minimal PDF deps.
- `./scripts/build.sh wezboard`, `./scripts/build.sh roamium`, and
  `./scripts/build.sh webtui` succeeded in debug mode.
- The GN PDF/plugin/extension precondition did not show an override disabling
  PDF, plugins, or extensions.
- `gn check out/Default //content/libtermsurf_chromium` is not usable as a clean
  PDF-dependency signal yet because the target already has private-header
  dependency errors unrelated to this experiment.

Failure-layer table:

| Layer                                                       | Result          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| PDF build flags enabled                                     | yes             |
| Minimal PDF deps compile                                    | yes             |
| PDF plugin registered in `AddPlugins()`                     | yes             |
| `OverrideCreatePlugin()` sees internal PDF MIME type        | no              |
| `CreateInternalPlugin()` returns a plugin                   | null-not-called |
| `IsPluginHandledExternally()` sees top-level PDF            | no              |
| Plugin created but viewer resources/MimeHandlerView missing | no              |
| Evidence that MimeHandlerView/extension layer is next       | likely          |
| Evidence that PDF stream routing is next                    | unknown         |
| Evidence that plugin/utility sandboxing is next             | no              |

Key log evidence:

```text
[issue-776] registered internal PDF plugin mime=application/x-google-chrome-pdf
Not implemented reached in content::ShellDownloadManagerDelegate::ChooseDownloadPath(...)
```

No `OverrideCreatePlugin()` or `IsPluginHandledExternally()` PDF log lines were
emitted. That means the top-level PDF navigation never reached the renderer
plugin creation path. Content Shell treated the PDF as a download before the
minimal renderer hook could create the internal PDF plugin.

The automation cleanup also produced a Roamium crash after the screenshot was
captured and the test process was torn down. That is a residual cleanup risk,
not the first PDF-rendering failure layer, because the screenshot and relevant
logs were already captured.

#### Conclusion

Experiment 1 proved that minimal renderer-side PDF plugin plumbing is
insufficient for top-level PDF navigation in TermSurf's Content Shell-based
embedder. Registering the internal PDF plugin works, but loading
`http://localhost:9616/bitcoin.pdf` goes through Content Shell's download path
and never reaches `IsPluginHandledExternally()` or `OverrideCreatePlugin()`.

The next experiment should target browser-side top-level PDF handling rather
than adding more renderer-only hooks. The likely missing layer is the
Chrome/Electron PDF navigation stack: PDF navigation interception,
MimeHandlerView/component-extension infrastructure, and eventually PDF stream
routing. Do not continue Experiment 2 as another renderer-client-only patch.

### Experiment 2: Route Top-Level PDFs to a PDF Wrapper

#### Description

Experiment 1 proved that renderer-side plugin registration is not reached for a
top-level PDF navigation. The important log line was:

```text
Not implemented reached in content::ShellDownloadManagerDelegate::ChooseDownloadPath(...)
```

That means Content Shell classifies the top-level PDF as a download before Blink
creates a plugin element and before `TsRendererClient` can call
`pdf::CreateInternalPlugin()`.

This experiment should add the smallest browser-side top-level PDF route in
TermSurf's Chromium embedder:

1. Detect a main-frame `application/pdf` response in
   `TsBrowserClient::CreateThrottlesForNavigation()`.
2. Cancel that navigation before it becomes a download.
3. Navigate the same tab to a small generated HTML wrapper that embeds the
   original PDF URL with Chromium's internal PDF plugin MIME type.

The wrapper approach is deliberately a probe, not a full Chrome PDF viewer port.
It tests whether TermSurf can reach the already-added renderer plugin path
without first porting MimeHandlerView, GuestView, the PDF component extension,
or streams-private. If this works, it may be enough for basic in-pane PDF
viewing. If it fails, the logs should prove exactly which PDF viewer substrate
is still missing.

Important constraint: a `data:` wrapper has an opaque origin. It may not be able
to embed an HTTP PDF, and it is not expected to embed a `file://` PDF under
default Chromium policy. Therefore HTTP-only success is not a full Issue 776
Pass. Issue 776's original goal is `web file.pdf`; this experiment only Passes
if both the HTTP fixture and the `file://` fixture render. If HTTP renders but
`file://` does not, record Partial and design the next experiment around a
non-opaque wrapper origin or a real MimeHandlerView path.

The generated wrapper should be minimal and visible only for top-level PDF
documents. A representative wrapper is:

```html
<!doctype html>
<meta charset="utf-8" />
<style>
  html,
  body,
  embed {
    margin: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    overflow: hidden;
    background: #f8d7da;
  }
</style>
<div id="termsurf-pdf-wrapper-marker">TermSurf PDF wrapper</div>
<embed src="{original_pdf_url}" type="application/x-google-chrome-pdf" />
```

The non-white background and marker are diagnostic scaffolding. They distinguish
"wrapper rendered but plugin is empty" from "wrapper did not render." The
experiment passes only if the automated screenshots show recognizable Bitcoin
PDF content for both HTTP and `file://`. Reaching `OverrideCreatePlugin()` or
`CreateInternalPlugin()` is useful evidence, but it is only a Partial result if
either screenshot remains blank or the `file://` case fails.

#### Changes

1. Create a new Chromium experiment branch from the current issue branch:
   `148.0.7778.97-issue-776-exp2`.
   - Do not commit directly to `148.0.7778.97-issue-776`.
   - Add the new branch to the Branches table in `chromium/README.md`.
   - Add a one-line note to `chromium/README.md` explaining that
     `{version}-issue-{N}-exp{M}` branches are allowed for follow-up Chromium
     experiments within an already-open issue.
   - Archive the branch under `chromium/patches/issue-776-exp2/` on Pass or
     Partial.

2. Add a browser-side PDF navigation throttle in `content/libtermsurf_chromium`,
   for example `ts_pdf_navigation_throttle.{cc,h}`.
   - Derive from `content::NavigationThrottle`.
   - Implement `WillProcessResponse()`.
   - Use `navigation_handle()->GetMimeType()` as the primary MIME signal because
     `file://` response headers may be synthetic or incomplete. Also log the
     MIME type reported by `GetResponseHeaders()` when headers exist, so the
     result can compare the two.
   - Only act when all of these are true:
     - the response MIME type is `pdf::kPDFMimeType` (`application/pdf`);
     - `navigation_handle()->IsInPrimaryMainFrame()` is true;
     - the target URL is not already the generated wrapper URL, as identified by
       a real sentinel rather than substring matching;
     - the URL scheme is ordinary browser content (`http`, `https`, or `file`)
       for this experiment.
   - Log every PDF decision with an `[issue-776-exp2]` prefix: URL, MIME type,
     main-frame status, and action.

3. When the throttle sees a top-level PDF response, cancel the current
   navigation and schedule a same-tab navigation to the generated wrapper.
   - Use `content::WebContents` from the navigation handle.
   - Preserve the existing tab; do not create a new window.
   - First probe a `data:text/html;charset=utf-8,...` URL for the wrapper,
     because it is the smallest implementation. Treat it as a probe, not the
     promised final architecture.
   - Include a deterministic wrapper sentinel, for example
     `termsurf-pdf-wrapper=1`, either in the generated URL or in a synthetic
     wrapper scheme. Use that sentinel for recursion prevention.
   - Store the original PDF URL in the wrapper's `<embed src=...>`.
   - Escape the original PDF URL for HTML attribute context before inserting it
     into the wrapper. URLs containing `&`, `"`, `'`, `<`, or `>` must not break
     the generated markup.
   - Set the `<embed>` type to `pdf::kInternalPluginMimeType`.
   - PostTask the wrapper navigation. Do not synchronously navigate the same
     `WebContents` from inside `WillProcessResponse()`, because the current
     navigation is still unwinding.
   - Return `content::NavigationThrottle::CANCEL_AND_IGNORE` after posting the
     wrapper navigation. Do not use `CANCEL`, `BLOCK_RESPONSE`, or an
     unspecified "closest" result.

4. Wire the throttle from `TsBrowserClient`.
   - Add a `CreateThrottlesForNavigation()` override to
     `ts_browser_client.{cc,h}`.
   - Call `ShellContentBrowserClient::CreateThrottlesForNavigation(registry)`
     first to preserve Content Shell behavior.
   - Then add the TermSurf PDF throttle.
   - Do not patch `content/shell/browser/shell_download_manager_delegate.cc` as
     the primary fix. That file should only be used as a diagnostic reference.

5. Keep Experiment 1's PDF plugin registration and renderer-client hooks.
   - Do not remove `TsContentClient`.
   - Do not remove `TsRendererClient`.
   - Keep the `[issue-776]` renderer/plugin logs for this experiment because
     they prove whether the wrapper reaches plugin creation.
   - Extend the renderer logs, if practical, so `OverrideCreatePlugin()` records
     the document URL/origin and PDF MIME type when it is asked to create a PDF
     plugin. This helps distinguish "plugin registered globally" from "plugin
     available in this document context."

6. Do not implement MimeHandlerView, GuestView, component-extension loading, or
   streams-private in this experiment.
   - If the wrapper reaches `CreateInternalPlugin()` but the screenshot is still
     blank, record Partial and design Experiment 3 around the missing substrate.
   - Do not silently widen this experiment into a partial Chrome PDF viewer
     port.
   - If the `data:` wrapper reaches the expected cross-origin or opaque-origin
     blocker, record Partial. Do not spend this experiment inventing a synthetic
     `ts-pdf://` or `chrome-untrusted://` wrapper unless the code is already
     trivial. That should be a separately designed experiment.

7. Harden the screenshot automation enough to trust the artifact.
   - Extend `scripts/test-issue-776-pdf.sh` so the log records the launched
     Wezboard PID and the command used for debug `web`.
   - Keep launching debug Wezboard, debug `web`, and repo-built Roamium only.
   - After foregrounding the process, capture the screenshot as before.
   - Record in the result whether the screenshot visibly shows the target URL
     `http://localhost:9616/bitcoin.pdf` or a generated PDF wrapper URL in the
     `web` URL bar. This does not replace the visual PDF-content check; it only
     proves the screenshot belongs to the intended run.

8. Build and run:
   - `autoninja -C out/Default libtermsurf_chromium`;
   - `./scripts/build.sh roamium`;
   - `./scripts/build.sh wezboard`;
   - `./scripts/build.sh webtui`;
   - `./scripts/test-issue-776-pdf.sh`.

9. Confirm whether the teardown crash seen in Experiment 1 recurs.
   - If Roamium crashes after the screenshot is captured, attach the crash stack
     or log excerpt to the result.
   - If Roamium crashes before the screenshot is captured, treat the experiment
     as Fail unless the logs still prove a clear next layer.

#### Non-Negotiable Invariants

- The fix remains Chromium/Roamium-side. Do not add PDF-specific logic to
  `webtui`.
- The existing browser pane is used. Do not open a native PDF window or an
  external app.
- The TermSurf protobuf protocol is unchanged.
- Normal HTML navigation, link clicks, scrolling, keyboard input, and local file
  navigation remain unchanged.
- The throttle only intercepts main-frame PDF responses. It must not hijack
  images, downloads, HTML pages, JavaScript resources, CSS, or arbitrary binary
  downloads.
- The implementation must not create a second tab or a second Chromium window.
- The generated wrapper must not recurse on itself.
- A `data:` wrapper is only a probe. HTTP-only rendering is Partial, not Pass,
  because the issue goal is local PDF rendering via `web file.pdf`.
- Experiment 2 must not quietly turn into a MimeHandlerView/component-extension
  port.

#### Verification

1. Confirm the branch and patch target:
   - Chromium branch: `148.0.7778.97-issue-776-exp2`;
   - eventual patch archive: `chromium/patches/issue-776-exp2/`.

2. Build the Chromium and Rust debug targets listed in the Changes section.

3. Run the automated PDF smoke test:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/test-issue-776-pdf.sh
   ```

4. Inspect the screenshot artifact.
   - Pass visual state: recognizable Bitcoin whitepaper content appears in the
     TermSurf browser pane.
   - Partial visual state: the page is still blank/white, but logs identify the
     next missing layer.
   - Partial visual state: the wrapper's diagnostic marker or non-white
     background appears, but no PDF content appears.
   - Fail visual state: the automation captured the wrong app/window, launched
     installed binaries, crashed before a screenshot, or regressed normal
     navigation.

5. Inspect logs and record these values in the result:

   | Layer                                                            | Result |
   | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
   | `TsPdfNavigationThrottle` sees `application/pdf` main-frame URL  | yes/no |
   | Throttle cancels top-level PDF before download path              | yes/no |
   | `ShellDownloadManagerDelegate::ChooseDownloadPath` no longer hit | yes/no |
   | Generated wrapper navigation starts in the same tab              | yes/no |
   | Wrapper marker/background is visible in screenshot               | yes/no |
   | `<embed>` appears to be blocked by wrapper origin                | yes/no |
   | `OverrideCreatePlugin()` sees internal PDF MIME type             | yes/no |
   | `CreateInternalPlugin()` returns a plugin                        | yes/no |
   | Screenshot shows recognizable PDF content                        | yes/no |

6. If the HTTP fixture renders, run the same automation against the local file
   URL. This is required before recording Pass:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/test-issue-776-pdf.sh \
     file:///Users/ryan/dev/termsurf/test-html/public/bitcoin.pdf
   ```

   If the HTTP fixture renders but this `file://` fixture does not, record
   Partial. The original issue is not solved.

7. Run a normal HTML smoke test after the PDF test:
   - open `https://example.com`;
   - click a link if available;
   - type in a text field on a simple test page;
   - confirm no download prompt, blank page, or navigation loop occurs.

8. Run a non-PDF binary/download smoke test after the PDF test.
   - Serve or open a non-PDF binary fixture, such as a `.zip` or `.bin`, from
     the local test server.
   - Confirm the PDF throttle does not intercept it as a PDF.

#### Pass Criteria

The automated screenshot for both fixtures shows recognizable Bitcoin PDF
content rendered inside the existing TermSurf browser overlay:

- `http://localhost:9616/bitcoin.pdf`;
- `file:///Users/ryan/dev/termsurf/test-html/public/bitcoin.pdf`.

Normal HTML navigation still works, and a non-PDF binary/download fixture is not
intercepted by the PDF throttle.

#### Partial Criteria

The throttle prevents the Content Shell download path and reaches a later PDF
layer, but the screenshot still does not show PDF content. The result must name
the first missing layer, such as:

- HTTP fixture renders but `file://` does not render;
- wrapper navigation starts but `<embed>` does not create a plugin;
- `data:` wrapper origin blocks the PDF `<embed>`;
- `CreateInternalPlugin()` returns `nullptr`;
- plugin is created but the viewer surface is blank;
- plugin is created but PDF resource fetching is blocked by origin or file
  access;
- plugin is created but MimeHandlerView/component-extension/streams-private is
  required after all.

#### Failure Criteria

- The screenshot automation is not trustworthy enough to identify the visible
  app state.
- The implementation does not intercept top-level PDF navigation before the
  Content Shell download path.
- The implementation intercepts non-PDF resources or normal HTML pages.
- The implementation creates a second tab/window or opens an external PDF app.
- The implementation adds PDF-specific behavior to `webtui`.
- The generated wrapper loops indefinitely.
- Roamium crashes while loading the PDF, before teardown.
- Normal HTML navigation regresses.

**Result:** Partial

Experiment 2 implemented the browser-side PDF navigation throttle and wrapper
probe on Chromium branch `148.0.7778.97-issue-776-exp2`. The throttle is wired
from `TsBrowserClient::CreateThrottlesForNavigation()`, detects top-level PDF
responses, cancels the original navigation with `CANCEL_AND_IGNORE`, and
asynchronously loads a diagnostic `data:` wrapper that embeds the original PDF
URL with `application/x-google-chrome-pdf`.

The automated HTTP PDF run completed and captured a trustworthy screenshot:

```text
/Users/ryan/dev/termsurf/logs/issue-776-exp2-20260527-082708/pdf-smoke.png
```

The screenshot shows the intended debug Wezboard run and generated wrapper URL.
The wrapper's diagnostic marker and pink background are visible, so the wrapper
loaded in the browser pane. The PDF content did not render. The center of the
pane shows Chromium's plugin failure message:

```text
Couldn't load plugin.
```

Key log evidence:

```text
[issue-776-exp2] pdf throttle response url=http://localhost:9616/bitcoin.pdf response_mime=application/pdf header_mime=application/pdf primary_main_frame=1 wrapper=0 supported_scheme=1

[issue-776] CreateInternalPlugin returned nullptr
```

Failure-layer table:

| Layer                                                            | Result |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| `TsPdfNavigationThrottle` sees `application/pdf` main-frame URL  | yes    |
| Throttle cancels top-level PDF before download path              | yes    |
| `ShellDownloadManagerDelegate::ChooseDownloadPath` no longer hit | yes    |
| Generated wrapper navigation starts in the same tab              | yes    |
| Wrapper marker/background is visible in screenshot               | yes    |
| `<embed>` appears to be blocked by wrapper origin                | no     |
| `OverrideCreatePlugin()` sees internal PDF MIME type             | yes    |
| `CreateInternalPlugin()` returns a plugin                        | no     |
| Screenshot shows recognizable PDF content                        | no     |

The implementation used `NavigationRequest::GetMimeType()` as the primary MIME
signal because Chromium 148 does not expose `NavigationHandle::GetMimeType()` on
the public `NavigationHandle` interface. Response headers are still logged for
comparison.

Additional verification:

- `autoninja -C out/Default libtermsurf_chromium` succeeded.
- `./scripts/build.sh roamium`, `./scripts/build.sh wezboard`, and
  `./scripts/build.sh webtui` succeeded.
- Normal HTML smoke test with `https://example.com` rendered correctly:
  `/Users/ryan/dev/termsurf/logs/issue-776-exp2-20260527-082751/pdf-smoke.png`.
  The throttle logged `response_mime=text/html` and did not intercept.
- Non-PDF binary smoke test with `http://localhost:9616/test.bin` was not
  intercepted by the PDF throttle. It reached Content Shell's normal download
  path with `response_mime=application/octet-stream`, which is expected for a
  non-PDF binary:
  `/Users/ryan/dev/termsurf/logs/issue-776-exp2-20260527-082902/pdf-smoke.png`.
- The `file://` PDF fixture was not run because the HTTP fixture did not render;
  the experiment was already Partial before the local-file requirement could be
  evaluated.
- The teardown crash from Experiment 1 recurred after screenshots were captured.
  It appears during test cleanup, after useful artifacts are written, but it is
  still a residual bug to address separately:

  ```text
  Received signal 11 SEGV_ACCERR
  ```

#### Conclusion

Experiment 2 proved that the next missing layer is after top-level PDF
navigation routing. TermSurf can now intercept a PDF response before Content
Shell turns it into a download, can load a same-tab wrapper, and can get Blink
to ask the renderer client for an internal PDF plugin.

The remaining blocker is that `pdf::CreateInternalPlugin()` returns `nullptr`
for this wrapper/plugin context. That rules out "the renderer hook is never
reached" as the primary problem and points to missing PDF plugin substrate:
plugin availability/permissions for the document context, required PDF renderer
initialization, or Chrome's MimeHandlerView/component-extension path.

Experiment 3 should focus on why `pdf::CreateInternalPlugin()` returns
`nullptr`, using the smallest targeted probe first. Do not keep adjusting the
top-level navigation throttle; it did its job.

### Experiment 3: Diagnose PDF Plugin Null Return

#### Description

Experiment 2 moved the failure forward. The browser-side throttle now prevents
Content Shell from treating the PDF as a download, the generated wrapper loads,
and Blink calls `TsRendererClient::OverrideCreatePlugin()` for
`application/x-google-chrome-pdf`.

The remaining failure is:

```text
[issue-776] CreateInternalPlugin returned nullptr
```

Chromium 148's implementation in
`components/pdf/renderer/internal_plugin_renderer_helpers.cc` has a small and
important first return path:

```cpp
blink::WebFrame* frame = render_frame->GetWebFrame();
blink::WebFrame* parent_frame = frame->Parent();
if (!parent_frame ||
    !IsPdfInternalPluginAllowedOrigin(parent_frame->GetSecurityOrigin(),
                                      additional_allowed_origins)) {
  return nullptr;
}
```

Only after this branch does Chromium `CHECK(IsPdfRenderer())`. Because
Experiment 2 returned `nullptr` instead of crashing, the most likely cause is
one of:

- the plugin frame has no parent frame;
- the wrapper's parent origin is not allowed to embed the internal PDF plugin.

That matches the design concern from Experiment 2: the `data:` wrapper has an
opaque origin and is probably not an allowed PDF embedder origin.

Experiment 3 should prove which branch returns `nullptr` and then run the
smallest targeted probe:

1. Add diagnostic logging around the exact parent-frame/origin checks.
2. If the plugin frame has no parent frame, reshape the wrapper so the PDF
   `<embed>` lives inside a child frame and re-run the probe.
3. If a parent frame exists but the parent origin is not allowed, pass that
   exact parent origin as an `additional_allowed_origins` probe to
   `pdf::CreateInternalPlugin()`.
4. Run the same automated screenshot test.

This is still a probe, not the final security model. If allowing the wrapper
origin gets past the `nullptr` branch but hits `CHECK(IsPdfRenderer())`, that is
valuable evidence: the plugin must run in a PDF renderer process, which points
toward the real Chrome/MimeHandlerView/component-extension flow. If it creates a
plugin but remains blank, the next missing layer is resource/stream plumbing. If
the child-frame wrapper gets past the missing-parent branch, that is also
diagnostic only; the real fix still needs a principled wrapper/process model.

#### Changes

1. Create a new Chromium experiment branch from the current branch:
   `148.0.7778.97-issue-776-exp3`.
   - Do not commit directly to `148.0.7778.97-issue-776-exp2`.
   - Add the new branch to the Branches table in `chromium/README.md`.
   - Archive the branch under `chromium/patches/issue-776-exp3/` on Pass or
     Partial.

2. Instrument `TsRendererClient::OverrideCreatePlugin()` in
   `content/libtermsurf_chromium/ts_renderer_client.cc`.
   - Before calling `pdf::CreateInternalPlugin()`, log:
     - plugin URL;
     - plugin MIME type;
     - whether `render_frame->GetWebFrame()` is non-null;
     - whether `frame->Parent()` is non-null;
     - frame security origin;
     - parent security origin;
     - whether the parent frame is a remote frame.
   - Use an `[issue-776-exp3]` log prefix.
   - If the needed Blink APIs are not easy to stringify, log the available
     booleans first and keep the experiment moving.

3. Add a local helper in `ts_renderer_client.cc` that calls
   `pdf::IsPdfInternalPluginAllowedOrigin()` for the parent origin.
   - Add any minimal deps/includes needed to access this function.
   - Log whether the parent origin is allowed with no extra origins.
   - If the function is not exported or cannot be used cleanly from
     `libtermsurf_chromium`, do not patch Chromium broadly just for logging.
     Instead, log the parent origin and infer the allowed-origin result from
     whether `CreateInternalPlugin()` returns `nullptr`.

4. Branch the probe based on the logged parent-frame state.
   - If `parent_frame == nullptr`, reshape the generated wrapper in
     `ts_pdf_navigation_throttle.cc` so the top-level wrapper contains a child
     frame, and the child frame contains the internal PDF `<embed>`.
   - Prefer the smallest shape first, such as:

     ```html
     <iframe
       srcdoc="...<embed src='{original_pdf_url}' type='application/x-google-chrome-pdf'>..."
     ></iframe>
     ```

   - Keep the diagnostic wrapper marker/background so the screenshot still
     distinguishes wrapper rendering from plugin rendering.
   - Log this as an `[issue-776-exp3] nested-wrapper probe`.
   - Re-run the automated PDF smoke test after this reshape.
   - Do not add a new wrapper scheme in this experiment.

5. If the parent frame exists but the parent origin is not allowed, run a
   minimal allowance probe:
   - call
     `pdf::CreateInternalPlugin(params, render_frame, base::span<const url::Origin>(&parent_origin, 1))`
     or the clean Chromium equivalent;
   - only do this for the Experiment 2 wrapper URL / internal PDF MIME path;
   - log that this is an `[issue-776-exp3] additional_allowed_origins probe`;
   - when the parent origin is opaque, pass the exact `url::Origin` value copied
     from `parent_frame->GetSecurityOrigin()`. Do not reconstruct it from the
     wrapper URL; a reconstructed opaque origin gets a different nonce and will
     not compare equal;
   - do not treat this as a final security model.

6. If `pdf::IsPdfInternalPluginAllowedOrigin()` is not callable from
   `libtermsurf_chromium`, also inspect the allowed-origin implementation in
   `components/pdf/common/pdf_util.*` or the relevant Chromium file and record
   the hardcoded allow-list in the result. Do not add broad exports just for
   logging.

7. Do not change the Experiment 2 top-level PDF throttle except for wrapper
   shape/logging needed by the parent-frame probe to correlate wrapper URL and
   plugin URL.
   - The throttle already proved it can bypass the download path.
   - Do not implement MimeHandlerView, GuestView, component-extension loading,
     or streams-private in this experiment.

8. Build and run:
   - `autoninja -C out/Default libtermsurf_chromium`;
   - `./scripts/build.sh roamium`;
   - `./scripts/build.sh wezboard`;
   - `./scripts/build.sh webtui`;
   - `./scripts/test-issue-776-pdf.sh`.

#### Non-Negotiable Invariants

- Do not change `webtui`.
- Do not change `termsurf.proto`.
- Do not change Wezboard overlay positioning or input forwarding.
- Do not patch the Content Shell download manager as the fix.
- Do not continue moving the navigation throttle; Experiment 2 already proved
  that layer works.
- Do not turn this into a MimeHandlerView/component-extension port.
- The `additional_allowed_origins` path is diagnostic only. If it works, the
  result must explicitly say that a real security model is still required.
- The nested-wrapper path is diagnostic only. If it works, the result must
  explicitly say that the final architecture still needs a stable wrapper and
  process model.
- Normal HTML navigation must continue to work.
- Non-PDF binary downloads must not be intercepted as PDFs.

#### Verification

1. Confirm the branch and patch target:
   - Chromium branch: `148.0.7778.97-issue-776-exp3`;
   - eventual patch archive: `chromium/patches/issue-776-exp3/`.

2. Build Chromium and Rust debug targets listed in the Changes section.

3. Run the automated HTTP PDF smoke test:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/test-issue-776-pdf.sh
   ```

4. Inspect logs and record:

   | Layer                                                         | Result |
   | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
   | `OverrideCreatePlugin()` reached                              | yes/no |
   | plugin frame exists                                           | yes/no |
   | parent frame exists                                           | yes/no |
   | parent frame is remote                                        | yes/no |
   | parent origin logged                                          | yes/no |
   | parent origin allowed without extra origins                   | yes/no |
   | nested-wrapper probe attempted                                | yes/no |
   | nested-wrapper probe creates a parent frame                   | yes/no |
   | `additional_allowed_origins` probe attempted                  | yes/no |
   | `CreateInternalPlugin()` returns plugin after allowance probe | yes/no |
   | process hits `CHECK(IsPdfRenderer())` after allowance probe   | yes/no |
   | screenshot shows recognizable PDF content                     | yes/no |

5. Inspect the screenshot artifact.
   - Pass visual state: recognizable Bitcoin PDF content appears in the TermSurf
     browser pane.
   - Partial visual state: logs identify the exact null-return cause or the next
     post-null blocker, but PDF content still does not render.
   - Partial visual state: a sad-tab / renderer-crashed view appears after an
     allowance or nested-wrapper probe. This is valid evidence if the logs show
     the crash happened at `CHECK(IsPdfRenderer())`.
   - Fail visual state: the experiment no longer reaches
     `OverrideCreatePlugin()`, breaks the wrapper route, regresses normal HTML,
     or crashes before producing useful logs.

   If `CHECK(IsPdfRenderer())` fires, the renderer process may crash before any
   later logs can run. Treat the screenshot and pre-crash log lines as the
   authoritative evidence for that branch.

6. Re-run the normal HTML smoke test from Experiment 2:

   ```bash
   TERMSURF_PDF_SETTLE_SECONDS=8 ./scripts/test-issue-776-pdf.sh \
     https://example.com
   ```

7. Re-run the non-PDF binary smoke test from Experiment 2:

   ```bash
   TERMSURF_PDF_SETTLE_SECONDS=8 ./scripts/test-issue-776-pdf.sh \
     http://localhost:9616/test.bin
   ```

   `TERMSURF_PDF_SETTLE_SECONDS` is provided by the existing
   `scripts/test-issue-776-pdf.sh` automation. Experiment 3 does not need to
   change the automation unless the nested-wrapper probe needs a longer settle
   time.

8. The teardown crash seen in Experiments 1 and 2 is expected to recur. The
   experiment is still valid if screenshots and logs are captured before the
   teardown crash. A crash before useful logs or screenshots is a Failure.

#### Pass Criteria

The automated PDF screenshot shows recognizable Bitcoin PDF content rendered in
the existing TermSurf browser overlay, normal HTML navigation still works, and
the non-PDF binary fixture is not intercepted by the PDF path.

If this passes only because of `additional_allowed_origins`, the result must
call out that this is a prototype security model and that a future experiment
must replace it with a principled wrapper/origin design before closing
Issue 776.

#### Partial Criteria

The screenshot still does not show PDF content, but the logs identify the exact
post-Experiment-2 blocker. Valid Partial outcomes include:

- parent frame is missing;
- nested-wrapper probe creates a parent frame but exposes a later blocker;
- parent origin is not allowed;
- allowing the wrapper origin gets past the `nullptr` branch but hits
  `CHECK(IsPdfRenderer())`;
- allowing the wrapper origin creates a plugin, but the plugin remains blank;
- plugin creation succeeds but PDF bytes/stream routing is missing;
- the evidence proves MimeHandlerView/component-extension infrastructure is
  required.

If `CHECK(IsPdfRenderer())` fires, the result must explicitly conclude that the
missing layer is the PDF renderer process model: browser-side renderer spawning
with PDF flags plus MimeHandlerView-style routing. Experiment 4 must address
that layer rather than continuing to adjust wrapper markup.

#### Failure Criteria

- The experiment breaks the Experiment 2 wrapper route.
- `OverrideCreatePlugin()` is no longer reached for the PDF wrapper.
- The implementation changes `webtui` or the TermSurf protocol.
- The experiment silently implements broad MimeHandlerView/extension plumbing.
- Normal HTML navigation regresses.
- Non-PDF binary responses are intercepted by the PDF path.
- Roamium crashes before producing enough logs to identify the blocker.

**Result:** Partial

Experiment 3 proved the next blocker after Experiment 2.

The first diagnostic run kept Experiment 2's top-level wrapper and added
renderer-side parent-frame/origin logging. It reproduced the `nullptr` result
and showed the exact first gate:

```text
[issue-776-exp3] plugin-context url=http://localhost:9616/bitcoin.pdf
mime=application/x-google-chrome-pdf frame_exists=true parent_exists=false
parent_is_remote=false frame_origin=null parent_origin=<none>
parent_origin_allowed=false
```

So the original `data:` wrapper was structurally wrong for Chromium's internal
PDF plugin: the plugin frame had no parent frame, and `CreateInternalPlugin()`
returned before reaching the PDF-renderer process check.

The second run changed the wrapper into the smallest nested-frame probe: the
top-level `data:` wrapper contains an `<iframe srcdoc=...>`, and that child
frame contains the internal PDF `<embed>`. That got past the missing-parent
branch:

```text
[issue-776-exp3] plugin-context url=http://localhost:9616/bitcoin.pdf
mime=application/x-google-chrome-pdf frame_exists=true parent_exists=true
parent_is_remote=false frame_origin=null parent_origin=null
parent_origin_allowed=false
[issue-776-exp3] additional_allowed_origins probe parent_origin=null
```

Passing the exact copied opaque parent origin as an `additional_allowed_origins`
diagnostic then advanced to Chromium's next hard gate:

```text
FATAL:components/pdf/renderer/internal_plugin_renderer_helpers.cc:61]
Check failed: IsPdfRenderer().
```

That is the important result. PDF rendering is not blocked by the navigation
throttle anymore, and not merely blocked by the wrapper's missing parent frame.
The next missing layer is Chromium's PDF renderer process model: browser-side
renderer spawning with the `--pdf-renderer` switch plus MimeHandlerView-style
routing. Continuing to adjust wrapper markup will not make the internal plugin
render in an ordinary content renderer.

- `https://example.com` rendered normally.
- `http://localhost:9616/test.bin` was not intercepted by the PDF throttle and
  still went through Content Shell's download path.
- The known teardown crash recurred after artifacts were captured; it did not
  invalidate the diagnostic result.

#### Conclusion

Experiment 3 moves Issue 776 from "wrapper/plugin creation unknown" to a
specific Chromium architecture gap. The wrapper can reach the internal PDF
plugin path, and a nested wrapper can satisfy the parent-frame precondition, but
Chromium refuses to create the internal PDF plugin outside a PDF renderer
process.

Experiment 4 should stop changing wrapper HTML and focus on the PDF renderer
process/MimeHandlerView layer: how Chrome causes a top-level PDF navigation to
spawn or route into a renderer with `--pdf-renderer`, how the PDF plugin frame's
parent becomes a remote trusted viewer frame, and which minimal subset of that
pipeline Roamium can adopt without porting all of Chrome's extension system.

### Experiment 4: Trace PDF Renderer Process Routing

#### Description

Experiment 3 proved that wrapper markup is no longer the load-bearing problem.
The nested wrapper creates a parent frame, and the diagnostic allowance probe
gets past the `nullptr` branch in `pdf::CreateInternalPlugin()`, but Chromium
then aborts at:

```text
CHECK(IsPdfRenderer())
```

The next question is therefore not "how do we write a better wrapper?" The next
question is:

> How does Chrome arrange for the internal PDF plugin frame to run inside a
> renderer process launched with the PDF renderer switch, and what is the
> smallest TermSurf/Roamium-compatible subset of that routing?

This experiment is a focused plumbing investigation. It should instrument and
minimally probe the PDF renderer process routing layer. The primary success
condition is not "PDF visibly renders"; that is only a stretch outcome. The
primary success condition is that the experiment identifies the exact
process-routing hook or proves that the Chrome MimeHandlerView/GuestView path is
the next unavoidable implementation unit.

The most likely outcome is that MimeHandlerView/GuestView/component-extension
infrastructure is required, because Chrome's trusted PDF parent frame is the PDF
viewer document. This experiment should treat that as a plausible successful
diagnosis, not as a failure to force one more wrapper adjustment.

The likely Chrome architecture is:

- top-level `application/pdf` navigation is intercepted before ordinary content
  rendering;
- Chrome creates or navigates to a trusted PDF viewer/MimeHandlerView document;
- the actual PDF plugin frame is placed below a trusted remote parent frame;
- the plugin renderer process is launched with `--pdf-renderer`;
- only then does `pdf::CreateInternalPlugin()` pass `CHECK(IsPdfRenderer())`.

Experiment 4 should prove this path in code and decide whether Roamium can
create the same process-routing condition without importing the entire Chrome
extension/PDF viewer stack.

#### Changes

1. Create a new Chromium experiment branch from `148.0.7778.97-issue-776-exp3`:
   `148.0.7778.97-issue-776-exp4`.
   - Do not commit directly to `148.0.7778.97-issue-776-exp3`.
   - Add the new branch to the Branches table in `chromium/README.md`.
   - Archive the branch under `chromium/patches/issue-776-exp4/` on Pass or
     Partial.

2. Research the exact upstream Chromium call chain that sets up a PDF renderer.
   Use local source only. Record file/function names in the result.

   Required search targets:

   ```bash
   rg "kPdfRenderer|--pdf-renderer|switches::kPdfRenderer" chromium/src
   rg "MimeHandlerView|CreateFrameContainer|IsPluginHandledExternally" chromium/src
   rg "application/pdf|kPDFMimeType|kInternalPluginMimeType" chromium/src/chrome chromium/src/components/pdf chromium/src/content
   rg "PluginResponseInterceptor|streams_private|pdf_viewer" chromium/src
   rg "AppendExtraCommandLineSwitches|GetEffectiveURL|ShouldUseProcessPerSite|RenderProcessHost::FromID" chromium/src/content chromium/src/chrome
   ```

   The result must identify:
   - where Chrome decides a PDF navigation should become a PDF viewer route;
   - where the trusted parent frame is created;
   - where a renderer is selected or launched with `--pdf-renderer`;
   - whether the plugin frame lands in a distinct `SiteInstance` / renderer
     process today;
   - what causes Chrome to give the PDF plugin frame a distinct process;
   - whether that selection depends on extensions, MimeHandlerView, GuestView, a
     Chrome content browser client override, or a navigation throttle;
   - whether Content Shell has any comparable hook that Roamium can reuse.

   Anchor the audit around these likely hooks:
   - `ContentBrowserClient::AppendExtraCommandLineSwitches(...)` for adding
     process-specific command-line switches;
   - `ContentBrowserClient::GetEffectiveURL(...)`,
     `ContentBrowserClient::ShouldUseProcessPerSite(...)`, and SiteInstance
     selection for deciding which renderer process a frame uses;
   - `RenderProcessHost::FromID(child_process_id)` for connecting command-line
     setup back to the process being decorated.

3. Add narrow instrumentation around renderer process creation and command-line
   setup in the TermSurf Chromium branch.
   - Log every renderer process command line when it is created or launched.
   - The log must show whether `--pdf-renderer` is present.
   - The expected baseline before any probe is that no renderer process carries
     `--pdf-renderer`.
   - Use `[issue-776-exp4]` as the prefix.
   - Prefer existing browser-client or content-shell embedder hooks before
     patching broad Chromium internals.

4. Add narrow instrumentation around the PDF wrapper/plugin route from
   Experiment 3.
   - Keep the Experiment 3 nested-wrapper probe and parent/origin logs.
   - Keep the Experiment 3 `additional_allowed_origins` diagnostic probe, but
     ensure all new process-type / command-line / `pdf::IsPdfRenderer()` logs
     are written before calling `pdf::CreateInternalPlugin()`.
   - Add the current process type or command-line PDF-renderer state to the
     `OverrideCreatePlugin()` diagnostic, using `pdf::IsPdfRenderer()` or direct
     command-line inspection.
   - Do not call `pdf::CreateInternalPlugin()` in a way that intentionally
     crashes before logging this state.

5. Run a minimal process-routing probe if the source audit identifies a small
   hook.

   Acceptable probes:
   - a browser-side navigation/content hook that marks only the internal PDF
     plugin child frame as requiring a PDF renderer process;
   - a TermSurf-only renderer command-line hook that adds `--pdf-renderer` only
     for a clearly identified PDF plugin renderer process;
   - a controlled experiment that proves such targeting is impossible without
     MimeHandlerView/GuestView by showing there is no distinct PDF plugin
     renderer process in the current wrapper route.

   Unacceptable probes:
   - add `--pdf-renderer` to every Roamium renderer process globally;
   - disable `CHECK(IsPdfRenderer())`;
   - weaken PDF origin checks as a proposed final fix;
   - silently import large Chrome extension/MimeHandlerView infrastructure;
   - change `webtui`, Wezboard, or `termsurf.proto`.

6. Build and run:

   ```bash
   cd chromium/src
   export PATH="$HOME/dev/termsurf/chromium/depot_tools:$PATH"
   autoninja -C out/Default libtermsurf_chromium
   cd ../..
   ./scripts/build.sh roamium
   ./scripts/build.sh wezboard
   ./scripts/build.sh webtui
   ./scripts/test-issue-776-pdf.sh
   ```

7. If a minimal process-routing probe passes `CHECK(IsPdfRenderer())`, continue
   only until the first new concrete blocker is reached.
   - If the plugin creates but remains blank, record whether the next missing
     layer is PDF bytes/stream routing, viewer resources, or `PdfHost` Mojo
     binding.
   - Do not keep layering fixes into this experiment.
   - If more than one missing layer appears likely, record the first proven one
     and design Experiment 5 around it.

#### Non-Negotiable Invariants

- Do not disable or bypass `CHECK(IsPdfRenderer())`.
- Do not globally mark all Roamium renderers as PDF renderers.
- Do not weaken PDF origin checks as a real fix.
- Do not import broad MimeHandlerView, GuestView, extension system, or
  `streams_private` infrastructure in this experiment.
- Do not change `webtui`, Wezboard, or `termsurf.proto`.
- Keep Experiment 2's navigation-throttle result intact: PDF navigations should
  still bypass the Content Shell download path.
- Keep Experiment 3's diagnostic visibility intact: logs must still show the
  wrapper/plugin frame state and whether the renderer is a PDF renderer.
- Normal HTML navigation must continue to work.
- Non-PDF binary downloads must not be intercepted as PDFs.

#### Verification

1. Confirm the branch and patch target:
   - Chromium branch: `148.0.7778.97-issue-776-exp4`;
   - eventual patch archive: `chromium/patches/issue-776-exp4/`.

2. Record the source-audit findings in the result:

   | Question                                                         | File/function answer |
   | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
   | Where is PDF navigation intercepted in Chrome?                   |                      |

   | Where is `--pdf-renderer` added or required?                     |                      |
   | Does the plugin frame land in its own process today?             |                      |
   | What causes Chrome to give the PDF plugin frame its own process? |                      |
   | Does the path require extensions/MimeHandlerView?                |                      |
   | Does `AppendExtraCommandLineSwitches` have enough information?   |                      |
   | Is there a smaller Content Shell/Roamium hook?                   |                      |

3. Build Chromium and Rust debug targets listed in the Changes section.

4. Run the automated PDF smoke test:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/test-issue-776-pdf.sh
   ```

5. Inspect logs and record:

   | Layer                                                        | Result |
   | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
   | PDF navigation still reaches wrapper throttle                | yes/no |
   | `OverrideCreatePlugin()` still reached                       | yes/no |
   | nested wrapper still creates a parent frame                  | yes/no |
   | renderer command line logged                                 | yes/no |
   | any renderer has `--pdf-renderer` before probe               | yes/no |
   | minimal process-routing probe attempted                      | yes/no |
   | targeted renderer gets `--pdf-renderer` after probe          | yes/no |
   | `CHECK(IsPdfRenderer())` is passed without disabling it      | yes/no |
   | plugin object is created                                     | yes/no |
   | screenshot shows recognizable PDF content                    | yes/no |
   | next blocker identified if PDF content still does not render | yes/no |

6. Re-run the normal HTML smoke test:

   ```bash
   TERMSURF_PDF_SETTLE_SECONDS=8 ./scripts/test-issue-776-pdf.sh \
     https://example.com
   ```

7. Re-run the non-PDF binary smoke test:

   ```bash
   TERMSURF_PDF_SETTLE_SECONDS=8 ./scripts/test-issue-776-pdf.sh \
     http://localhost:9616/test.bin
   ```

8. The known teardown crash remains out of scope. The experiment is valid if
   screenshots and logs are captured before teardown. A crash before useful
   process-routing logs is a Failure.

#### Pass Criteria

The experiment identifies and verifies the PDF renderer process-routing layer. A
Pass does not require visible PDF rendering.

Pass if all of these are true:

- the source audit identifies the Chrome file/function chain for PDF navigation
  interception, trusted parent/viewer frame creation, SiteInstance/process
  selection, and `--pdf-renderer` setup;
- runtime instrumentation proves whether the current Roamium wrapper route has a
  distinct PDF plugin renderer process;
- the experiment either identifies a concrete small Roamium hook to try next or
  proves that MimeHandlerView/GuestView/component-extension infrastructure is
  the next required implementation unit;
- normal HTML still works;
- non-PDF binary responses are not intercepted by the PDF path.

Stretch Pass: the automated PDF screenshot shows recognizable Bitcoin PDF
content rendered in the existing TermSurf browser overlay, and the result
identifies the exact process-routing hook that made `pdf::IsPdfRenderer()` true
without weakening the PDF renderer check or marking all renderers as PDF
renderers.

#### Partial Criteria

The experiment advances the diagnosis but does not fully answer the
process-routing question. Valid Partial outcomes include:

- the source audit proves MimeHandlerView/GuestView/extension infrastructure is
  likely required but does not yet identify the exact file/function boundary
  where Roamium should hook in;
- the probe can target a PDF renderer process and pass `CHECK(IsPdfRenderer())`,
  but plugin creation then blocks on `PdfHost` Mojo binding;
- the probe can create the plugin, but PDF bytes/stream routing is missing;
- the probe can create the plugin, but PDF viewer resources are missing;
- the current wrapper route has no distinct renderer process that can be marked
  as PDF-only without globally affecting ordinary web content.

#### Failure Criteria

- The experiment disables or bypasses `CHECK(IsPdfRenderer())`.
- The experiment adds `--pdf-renderer` to all Roamium renderers globally.
- The experiment changes `webtui`, Wezboard, or the TermSurf protocol.
- The experiment silently imports broad MimeHandlerView/extension plumbing
  instead of recording that as the next scoped experiment.
- The PDF navigation no longer reaches the wrapper throttle.
- `OverrideCreatePlugin()` is no longer reached.
- Normal HTML navigation regresses.
- Non-PDF binary responses are intercepted by the PDF path.
- The result still says only "PDF blank" without identifying the next concrete
  missing layer.

**Result:** Pass

Experiment 4 identified and verified the PDF renderer process-routing layer. The
current Roamium wrapper route still reaches the PDF wrapper throttle and still
reaches `OverrideCreatePlugin()`, but the plugin frame is hosted by an ordinary
renderer process:

```text
[issue-776-exp4] append-command-line child_process_id=7 process_type=renderer
host_exists=true host_is_pdf=false has_pdf_renderer=false
```

Immediately before calling `pdf::CreateInternalPlugin()`, the renderer-side log
also proves the same state:

```text
[issue-776-exp4] renderer-plugin-state process_type=renderer
has_pdf_renderer_switch=false pdf_IsPdfRenderer=false parent_exists=true
parent_is_remote=false
```

The unchanged Chromium check then aborts at:

```text
FATAL:components/pdf/renderer/internal_plugin_renderer_helpers.cc:61]
Check failed: IsPdfRenderer().
```

That crash is expected for this experiment. It proves the wrapper is not enough:
the plugin frame is still a normal local child frame, not PDF content in a PDF
renderer process under a trusted remote PDF viewer parent.

| Does the path require extensions/MimeHandlerView?                | Yes. Chrome's path uses the PDF extension URL, `MimeHandlerViewAttachHelper`, `MimeHandlerViewEmbedder`, `MimeHandlerViewGuest`, and `PdfViewerStreamManager`.                           |
| Does `AppendExtraCommandLineSwitches` have enough information?   | No. It can observe the `RenderProcessHost`, but `--pdf-renderer` is appended later from `RenderProcessHost::IsPdf()`; it is not the routing decision point.                              |
| Is there a smaller Content Shell/Roamium hook?                   | Not at this layer. The small hook would need to create a PDF `SiteInstance`/PDF navigation for only the plugin content frame, which is exactly what the Chrome PDF viewer path supplies. |

#### Conclusion

Experiment 4 proves that the next missing layer is not wrapper HTML, plugin
registration, MIME detection, or renderer-client plumbing. The missing layer is
Chrome's PDF viewer process-routing substrate.

In Chromium, PDF content becomes PDF renderer content only after the Chrome PDF
viewer path creates the trusted viewer/extension frame, tracks stream state, and
starts the PDF content navigation with `is_pdf = true`. That flag is what
eventually makes the `SiteInstance` and `RenderProcessHost` PDF-specific, and
only then does Chromium append `--pdf-renderer`.

Roamium's current wrapper has no distinct PDF plugin renderer process to mark.
Adding `--pdf-renderer` from `AppendExtraCommandLineSwitches()` would either be
too late for routing or would require globally marking ordinary renderers as PDF
renderers, which the experiment explicitly forbids.

Experiment 5 should stop probing wrapper variants and should choose one of two
larger directions:

1. port the smallest viable Chrome PDF viewer substrate: PDF response
   interception, PDF viewer resources, `MimeHandlerView`/GuestView container
   setup, stream tracking, and PDF `is_pdf` content-frame navigation; or
2. choose a product fallback for PDFs, such as opening an external viewer, if
   the Chrome viewer substrate is too large for TermSurf right now.

### Experiment 5: Map Electron's PDF Viewer Port

#### Description

Experiment 4 proved that TermSurf cannot make PDFs render by only wrapping the
URL in HTML or registering the internal PDF plugin. The missing piece is the
Chrome PDF viewer substrate that creates a trusted viewer frame, routes the PDF
stream, and starts the PDF content frame as an `is_pdf` navigation so Chromium
launches a renderer with `--pdf-renderer`.

Electron already solved this problem for a content-shell-derived embedder. It is
therefore the best implementation guide. This experiment should map Electron's
PDF viewer integration against TermSurf/Roamium and decide the smallest
copy/adapt sequence that can plausibly make in-pane PDF viewing work.

This is a design and port-planning experiment. It should not implement the port
yet. Its output must be recorded directly in this experiment's Result section,
not in separate files.

2. Record an Electron component map directly in the Result section using this
   table:

   | Electron component/file | Role in PDF loading | TermSurf equivalent | Port classification |
   | ----------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |

   `Port classification` must be one of:
   - copy mostly as-is;
   - adapt to TermSurf;
   - replace with smaller TermSurf stub;
   - unnecessary for first rendering pass;
   - blocker / requires larger architecture.

3. Record the Chromium/Chrome substrate map directly in the Result section using
   this table:

   | Chrome/Chromium layer | Why PDF needs it | Electron usage | TermSurf status |
   | --------------------- | ---------------- | -------------- | --------------- |

   The map must cover at least:
   - internal PDF plugin registration;
   - renderer-side `OverrideCreatePlugin()`;
   - renderer-side `IsPluginHandledExternally()`;
   - `MimeHandlerViewContainerManager`;
   - `MimeHandlerViewAttachHelper`;
   - `MimeHandlerViewEmbedder`;
   - `MimeHandlerViewGuest`;
   - `GuestViewManager`;
   - component extension resource manager / PDF viewer resources;
   - `streams_private`;
   - `pdf_viewer_private`;
   - `PluginResponseInterceptorURLLoaderThrottle`;
   - `PDFIFrameNavigationThrottle`;
   - `pdf::PdfNavigationThrottle`;
   - `pdf::PdfURLLoaderRequestInterceptor`;
   - `pdf::PdfViewerStreamManager`;
   - `pdf::PDFDocumentHelper` / `pdf::mojom::PdfHost`;
   - the `is_pdf` navigation path that causes `--pdf-renderer`.

4. Compare Electron's architecture to TermSurf's current branch
   `148.0.7778.97-issue-776-exp4`.

   For each required layer, answer:
   - already present in TermSurf?
   - present but incomplete?
   - absent but copyable from Electron?
   - absent and dependent on broader extension infrastructure?
   - absent and likely better stubbed for a first rendering pass?

5. Decide the smallest viable port sequence.

   The result must include an ordered implementation plan for Experiment 6 and
   later experiments. Each step must be small enough to build and verify
   independently.

   The sequence should prefer Electron's proven path, but it must not blindly
   copy unrelated Electron features. The first implementation experiment should
   aim for the first observable milestone, not the complete final PDF feature.

   Candidate milestones:
   - PDF viewer component resources are registered and can be resolved;
   - `streams_private` equivalent stores a PDF stream in
     `PdfViewerStreamManager`;
   - `PluginResponseInterceptorURLLoaderThrottle` feeds the PDF viewer payload;
   - `MimeHandlerViewContainerManager` creates the container frame;
   - the PDF content frame navigation is marked `is_pdf`;
   - a renderer process is launched with `--pdf-renderer`;
   - `pdf::CreateInternalPlugin()` passes `CHECK(IsPdfRenderer())`;
   - `pdf::mojom::PdfHost` binding is reached;
   - the Bitcoin PDF visibly renders.

6. Record a cost/risk assessment directly in the Result section.

   Required table:

   | Risk | Evidence | Mitigation |
   | ---- | -------- | ---------- |

   Include at least:
   - binary size / dependency expansion;
   - extension-system coupling;
   - security model for trusted PDF origins;
   - local `file://` PDF access;
   - teardown crash already seen in PDF automation;
   - future Chromium upgrade maintenance;
   - whether external fallback should remain an option.

7. Do not make Chromium, Rust, protocol, or script changes in this experiment.
   This experiment is complete when the Result section contains a concrete port
   map and a recommended next implementation experiment.

#### Non-Negotiable Invariants

- Do not implement the PDF viewer port in Experiment 5.
- Do not create separate result files. The mapping tables, conclusions, and
  next-step recommendation must be written directly under Experiment 5.
- Use `vendor/electron/` and `chromium/src/` local source only.
- Do not weaken `CHECK(IsPdfRenderer())`.
- Do not propose globally adding `--pdf-renderer` to ordinary renderers.
- Do not choose a wrapper-only approach unless the result explicitly explains
  why Electron's architecture is unnecessary despite Experiment 4 proving the
  opposite.
- Do not close Issue 776.

#### Verification

1. Confirm no implementation files changed:

   ```bash
   git diff --name-only
   git -C chromium/src diff --name-only
   ```

   Expected: only `issues/0776-pdf-not-loading/README.md` changes in the main
   repo; no Chromium source changes.

2. Confirm the Result section contains:
   - Electron component map;
   - Chrome/Chromium substrate map;
   - TermSurf gap classification;
   - ordered implementation sequence for Experiment 6+;
   - cost/risk table;
   - explicit recommendation: port path, fallback path, or stop.

3. Confirm the recommendation names the first implementation milestone and its
   verification signal.

4. Format this issue document with:

   ```bash
   prettier --write --prose-wrap always --print-width 80 \
     issues/0776-pdf-not-loading/README.md
   ```

#### Pass Criteria

Pass if the experiment produces a concrete, source-backed port plan showing how
Electron's PDF viewer integration maps onto TermSurf, and identifies the next
small implementation experiment.

#### Partial Criteria

Partial if the experiment identifies most of the Electron/Chromium components
but cannot yet determine whether the first implementation step should target
component resources, `streams_private`, `MimeHandlerView`, or PDF process
routing.

#### Failure Criteria

- The result is vague and only says "copy Electron."
- The result omits the dependency order.
- The result is written to separate files instead of this experiment.
- The result proposes another wrapper-only experiment without addressing the
  `--pdf-renderer` / `is_pdf` process-routing requirement.
- The experiment modifies implementation code.

**Result:** Pass

Electron is the right guide, but the useful lesson is not "copy one function."
Electron's PDF support is a small browser feature stack layered on top of
content shell: component extension loading, PDF viewer resources, intercepted
PDF streams, MimeHandlerView / GuestView plumbing, renderer plugin creation, and
PDF renderer process routing.

Experiment 4 failed because TermSurf tried to jump from "PDF response detected"
directly to "internal plugin exists." Electron shows the missing middle: the PDF
response is first converted into a PDF viewer document, the PDF bytes are stored
in a stream manager, the viewer creates a PDF content frame, and that content
frame is navigated with `is_pdf = true`. Chromium then handles the PDF renderer
process routing itself. TermSurf does not need to manually spawn or manage a PDF
process, but it does need to enter Chromium's normal PDF viewer path.

Recommended implementation sequence:

1. **Experiment 6: register the PDF viewer component extension resources.** Port
   the smallest TermSurf equivalent of Electron's component extension resource
   manager and PDF component-extension registration. Do not switch navigation to
   the Chrome PDF path yet. Verification signal: the Chromium branch builds,
   `kPdfResources` are registered, PDF viewer template replacements for
   `extension_misc::kPdfExtensionId` are present, and a targeted log/probe
   proves the PDF viewer extension URL can resolve bundled resources.
2. **Experiment 7: add TermSurf `streams_private` and the interceptor
   redirect.** Port Electron's `streams_private` shape narrowly enough to
   receive `SendExecuteMimeTypeHandlerEvent()` and create/feed
   `PdfViewerStreamManager`. Apply the Electron-style Chromium patch that
   redirects `PluginResponseInterceptorURLLoaderThrottle` to the TermSurf API.
   Verification signal: loading `bitcoin.pdf` logs the interceptor, the TermSurf
   `streams_private` handler, and
   `PdfViewerStreamManager::AddStreamContainer()`.
3. **Experiment 8: wire the browser-side PDF throttles and URL loader
   interceptor.** Replace TermSurf's wrapper-only `TsPdfNavigationThrottle` with
   Electron's `PDFIFrameNavigationThrottle`, `pdf::PdfNavigationThrottle`, and
   `pdf::PdfURLLoaderRequestInterceptor` sequence. Verification signal: the PDF
   stream URL is mapped back to the original URL and a PDF content-frame
   navigation is created with `is_pdf = true`.
4. **Experiment 9: wire the renderer MimeHandlerView container path.** Bind
   `MimeHandlerViewContainerManager`, implement the smallest TermSurf GuestView
   / MimeHandlerView delegates needed for the PDF viewer, and make
   `IsPluginHandledExternally()` create the frame container. Verification
   signal: logs show `CreateFrameContainer()` and the PDF extension frame exists
   under the embedder.
5. **Experiment 10: bind `pdf::mojom::PdfHost`.** Add a small
   `PDFDocumentHelperClient` equivalent. Verification signal:
   `pdf::CreateInternalPlugin()` runs in a renderer launched with
   `--pdf-renderer`, passes `CHECK(IsPdfRenderer())`, and the `PdfHost` binder
   is reached.
6. **Experiment 11: visual render and local-file verification.** Run the
   automated screenshot test against the vendored Bitcoin PDF over HTTP and then
   `file://`. Verification signal: the first page visibly renders in the pane;
   local-file behavior is either working or recorded as a focused follow-up.

#### Conclusion

The next experiment should not try another wrapper. The smallest useful next
milestone is **Experiment 6: register and serve the PDF viewer component
extension resources in TermSurf's Chromium embedder**. That milestone is
buildable and verifiable without yet switching the navigation path, and it
establishes the trusted PDF viewer origin/resource substrate that later
experiments need.

After that, the critical path is Electron's stream path:
`PluginResponseInterceptorURLLoaderThrottle` -> TermSurf `streams_private` ->
`PdfViewerStreamManager` -> `pdf::PdfNavigationThrottle` with `is_pdf = true` ->
Chromium launches the PDF renderer. Chromium handles the PDF process once
TermSurf enters that path.

### Experiment 6: Register PDF Viewer Component Resources

#### Description

Experiment 5 identified the first useful Electron-style milestone: establish the
trusted PDF viewer extension resource substrate before changing navigation or
stream routing.

This experiment ports the smallest possible TermSurf-owned data substrate for
Electron's PDF component-extension resources. It should prove that TermSurf can
construct a PDF-only resource manager, parse the PDF viewer manifest, register
PDF viewer template replacements, and resolve known PDF viewer resource paths
through an explicit TermSurf lookup API.

This is intentionally a substrate experiment. A successful result means the
viewer resources are buildable and resolvable inside TermSurf-owned code. It
does not yet mean Chromium can serve a `chrome-extension://...` PDF viewer URL
through its normal URL loader path. If true URL serving requires
`ExtensionsBrowserClient`, `ExtensionRegistry`, or `ExtensionSystem`, mark this
experiment Partial and design the next experiment around that integration point.
PDF pages may still download or fail exactly as they do after Experiment 4.

#### Changes

1. Create a new Chromium branch for this experiment.

   Branch from `148.0.7778.97-issue-776-exp4`:

   ```bash
   git -C chromium/src checkout 148.0.7778.97-issue-776-exp4
   git -C chromium/src checkout -b 148.0.7778.97-issue-776-exp6
   ```

   Add the branch to `chromium/README.md` with a short note:

   > Issue 776 Experiment 6: PDF viewer component resources.

2. Audit Electron's resource path before porting.

   Re-read these files and record any version-specific differences in the
   result:

   ```bash
   sed -n '1,220p' \
     vendor/electron/shell/browser/extensions/electron_component_extension_resource_manager.cc
   sed -n '1,180p' \
     vendor/electron/shell/browser/extensions/electron_extension_system.cc
   sed -n '1,120p' \
     vendor/electron/shell/common/plugin_info.cc
   ```

   Confirm these Chromium 148 symbols and generated resources exist:

   ```bash
   rg "kPdfResources|IDR_PDF" chromium/src/chrome/grit chromium/src/out/Default/gen/chrome -n
   rg "GetManifest|GetStrings|PdfViewerContext" \
     chromium/src/chrome/browser/pdf chromium/src/chrome/common -n
   rg "kPdfExtensionId|kPDFMimeType|kInternalPluginMimeType" \
     chromium/src/extensions chromium/src/components/pdf chromium/src/content/libtermsurf_chromium -n
   ```

   If any of these Chromium 148 symbols or generated resource maps are missing,
   stop before implementation and record the mismatch. Do not proceed using the
   Electron paths by assumption.

3. Run a baseline Chromium build before changing files.

   ```bash
   autoninja -C chromium/src/out/Default libtermsurf_chromium
   ```

   Record whether the baseline passes. If it fails, capture the pre-existing
   failure and decide whether the experiment can still proceed. This separates
   Experiment 6 build failures from unrelated branch state.

4. Add a TermSurf PDF component resource manager.

   Create a small TermSurf-owned Chromium file pair under
   `content/libtermsurf_chromium/`, for example:
   - `ts_pdf_component_extension_resource_manager.h`
   - `ts_pdf_component_extension_resource_manager.cc`

   The class should mirror only the PDF-relevant part of Electron's
   `ElectronComponentExtensionResourceManager`:
   - include `chrome/grit/pdf_resources_map.h`;
   - include `chrome/browser/pdf/pdf_extension_util.h`;
   - register `kPdfResources`;
   - register template replacements for `extension_misc::kPdfExtensionId` using
     `pdf_extension_util::GetStrings(PdfViewerContext::kPdfViewer)`;
   - expose a small lookup/probe API that can answer:
     - is this resource path a PDF component extension resource?
     - are template replacements registered for the PDF extension id?
     - can a known PDF viewer resource path resolve to a non-zero resource id?
     - can the PDF viewer manifest parse as a dictionary?

   Do not add general extension support. This class is PDF-only.

   The initial owner should be a process-global TermSurf PDF resource probe
   owned by `TsBrowserClient` startup code. Do not hide the ownership decision
   inside an unrelated utility or `TsContentClient`. Later experiments may move
   the object behind a minimal `ExtensionsBrowserClient` if Chromium's URL
   serving path requires it.

5. Add a concrete PDF extension info struct.

   Port the minimal metadata from Electron's `shell/common/plugin_info.cc` into
   a TermSurf-owned `TsPdfExtensionInfo` helper or equivalent constexpr/static
   table. This is not an extension registry. It is a named source of truth for
   the facts the resource probe will log:
   - PDF extension id is `extension_misc::kPdfExtensionId`;
   - handled MIME type is `pdf::kPDFMimeType`;
   - internal plugin MIME type remains `pdf::kInternalPluginMimeType`;
   - PDF extension manifest comes from `pdf_extension_util::GetManifest()`.

   Do not change the existing internal plugin registration in
   `TsContentClient::AddPlugins()` except for adding diagnostic output if
   useful.

6. Wire the resource manager into TermSurf startup only far enough to create and
   probe it.

   Initialize the probe from `TsBrowserClient` startup code and log the probe
   result once per browser process. The experiment should not yet require
   `extensions::ExtensionsBrowserClient`, `ExtensionSystem`,
   `ExtensionRegistry`, `GuestViewManager`, or `MimeHandlerViewGuest`.

   If a Chromium API requires one of those systems just to instantiate the
   resource manager, stop and mark the experiment Partial. Do not silently grow
   Experiment 6 into a full extension-system port.

7. Add gated diagnostics for the probe.

   Add a TermSurf-specific log prefix such as `[issue-776-exp6]`. On startup,
   log:
   - whether PDF viewer resources were registered;
   - number of registered PDF resource paths;
   - whether template replacements exist for `extension_misc::kPdfExtensionId`;
   - whether a known PDF resource path resolves to a non-zero resource id;
   - the first few PDF resource path keys;
   - whether `pdf_extension_util::GetManifest()` parses as a dictionary.

   Keep the log low-volume and deterministic. It may be unconditional during the
   experiment, or gated behind an env var such as `TERMSURF_PDF_TRACE=1`.

8. Update GN deps only for the resource milestone.

   Add the minimum dependencies needed by the TermSurf resource manager. Likely
   candidates include:
   - generated grit/resource targets that provide `pdf_resources_map.h`;
   - `//extensions/common` for `extension_misc::kPdfExtensionId`;
   - `//ui/base` for template replacements, if needed.

   Do not treat `//chrome/browser/pdf` as a default dependency. First look for a
   narrower GN target that exposes `pdf_extension_util.{h,cc}` or the specific
   PDF extension utility functions needed by the probe. If no narrow target
   exists, choose one of these explicit outcomes:
   - fork the small `pdf_extension_util` manifest/string logic into
     TermSurf-owned code for this experiment; or
   - mark the experiment Partial and design the next experiment around the
     smallest safe Chrome PDF dependency boundary.

   Do not add `//extensions/browser`, `//extensions/renderer`,
   `GuestViewManager`, `MimeHandlerViewGuest`, `streams_private`, or
   `pdf_viewer_private` deps in this experiment unless compilation proves a tiny
   resource-only dependency already requires them. If that happens, record the
   dependency reason in the result before proceeding.

9. Build Chromium and Roamium enough to prove the branch is coherent.

   ```bash
   autoninja -C chromium/src/out/Default libtermsurf_chromium
   ./scripts/build.sh roamium
   ```

   If the normal build script is more reliable for the Chromium dylib, this is
   also acceptable:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/build.sh chromium
   ./scripts/build.sh roamium
   ```

10. Regenerate the Chromium patch archive if the experiment passes or produces a
    coherent Partial worth preserving.

    Use `chromium/patches/issue-776-exp6/`. The archive should capture only the
    Experiment 6 Chromium branch changes. Do not archive an incoherent failed
    spike.

#### Non-Negotiable Invariants

- Do not attempt to render PDFs in this experiment.
- Do not remove or rewrite the existing Experiment 4 wrapper throttle yet.
- Do not add `streams_private`, `pdf_viewer_private`, MimeHandlerView,
  GuestView, or `PdfHost` implementation in this experiment.
- Do not weaken `CHECK(IsPdfRenderer())`.
- Do not globally add `--pdf-renderer` to ordinary renderers.
- Do not enable general user extension support.
- Do not change the TermSurf protocol.
- Do not close Issue 776.

#### Verification

1. Confirm branch and files:

   ```bash
   git -C chromium/src branch --show-current
   git -C chromium/src diff --name-only
   git diff --name-only
   ```

   Expected:
   - Chromium branch is `148.0.7778.97-issue-776-exp6`;
   - Chromium changes are limited to TermSurf Chromium PDF resource plumbing and
     any required BUILD.gn edits;
   - main repo changes are limited to `chromium/README.md`, the issue document,
     and the regenerated Issue 776 patch archive, if applicable.

2. Build:

   ```bash
   autoninja -C chromium/src/out/Default libtermsurf_chromium
   ./scripts/build.sh roamium
   ```

   Or:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/build.sh chromium
   ./scripts/build.sh roamium
   ```

   Record which command was used and whether it passed.

3. Run a lightweight startup probe.

   Start Roamium through the normal debug test path with `TERMSURF_PDF_TRACE=1`,
   or use any existing Chromium logging path that captures `LOG(INFO)` from
   `libtermsurf_chromium`.

   Confirm logs contain:
   - `[issue-776-exp6] pdf resources registered=true`;
   - `[issue-776-exp6] pdf template replacements registered=true`;
   - `[issue-776-exp6] pdf manifest parsed=true`;
   - `[issue-776-exp6] pdf known resource resolved=true`;
   - the PDF extension id.

4. Confirm no behavior change is claimed.

   Load the vendored Bitcoin PDF with the existing automated screenshot test.
   The screenshot may still show the pre-existing failure. That is acceptable.
   This experiment only passes on resource substrate readiness, not visible PDF
   rendering.

5. Run normal browsing smoke tests.

   Verify an ordinary HTML page still loads, for example `https://example.com`.
   Verify a non-PDF binary such as `http://localhost:9616/test.bin` still
   follows the pre-existing download/non-render path. Record both outcomes in
   the result.

6. Record the result directly under this experiment.

   Include:
   - exact Chromium files changed;
   - exact BUILD.gn deps added;
   - whether `//chrome/browser/pdf` was avoided, forked, or forced;
   - resource probe log lines;
   - binary size before/after if easy to capture;
   - whether Experiment 7 should proceed to `streams_private` / interceptor
     redirect or whether Experiment 6 exposed an earlier blocker.

7. Format this issue document:

   ```bash
   prettier --write --prose-wrap always --print-width 80 \
     issues/0776-pdf-not-loading/README.md
   ```

#### Pass Criteria

Pass if Chromium builds and TermSurf logs prove that a TermSurf-owned PDF
resource manager can:

- register the PDF viewer component resources;
- parse the PDF extension manifest;
- expose the PDF extension id;
- register PDF viewer template replacements;
- resolve at least one known PDF viewer resource path to a non-zero resource id;
- do all of the above without enabling general extension support.

This Pass does **not** require Chromium URL loaders to serve
`chrome-extension://...` PDF viewer resources. If the implementation attempts to
prove real URL serving and discovers that Chromium requires
`ExtensionsBrowserClient::GetComponentExtensionResourceManager()` or a related
extension-system object, the correct result is Partial, not a stretched Pass.

#### Partial Criteria

Partial if some resource substrate works, but the experiment discovers that even
resource resolution requires a broader extension-system object such as
`ExtensionsBrowserClient`, `ExtensionRegistry`, or `ExtensionSystem`. The result
must name the exact missing object and design Experiment 7 around that object.

#### Failure Criteria

- The experiment tries to render PDFs instead of proving resource substrate.
- The experiment silently expands into `streams_private`, MimeHandlerView,
  GuestView, or `PdfHost`.
- The experiment weakens PDF renderer security checks.
- The experiment adds broad extension support without a focused PDF-only reason.
- The experiment builds only by adding unrelated Chrome app/browser features.
- The result claims success without log/probe evidence that PDF resources and
  template replacements are registered.

**Result:** Pass

Experiment 6 established the PDF viewer component-resource substrate without
turning on the general extension system.

Chromium branch:

- `148.0.7778.97-issue-776-exp6`

Chromium files changed:

- `content/libtermsurf_chromium/BUILD.gn`
- `content/libtermsurf_chromium/ts_browser_client.cc`
- `content/libtermsurf_chromium/ts_browser_client.h`
- `content/libtermsurf_chromium/ts_pdf_component_extension_resource_manager.cc`
- `content/libtermsurf_chromium/ts_pdf_component_extension_resource_manager.h`

The new `TsPdfComponentExtensionResourceManager` is owned by `TsBrowserClient`
startup code and logs a one-time resource probe. It registers the generated
`kPdfResources` map, exposes the PDF extension metadata, loads the browser
resource pack, parses `IDR_PDF_MANIFEST`, and registers minimal TermSurf-owned
template replacements.

`//chrome/browser/pdf` was avoided. Chromium 148 does not expose
`pdf_extension_util` through a narrow dependency suitable for this experiment,
so the probe uses generated resources directly:

- `chrome/grit/pdf_resources_map.h` for PDF viewer resource path registration;
- `chrome/grit/browser_resources.h` and `IDR_PDF_MANIFEST` for manifest parsing;
- a small TermSurf-owned template replacement table for this resource milestone.

BUILD.gn deps added:

- `//base`
- `//chrome/browser:resources`
- `//chrome/browser/resources/pdf:resources`
- `//extensions/common:common_constants`
- `//ui/base`

Deps intentionally not added:

- `//chrome/browser/pdf`
- `//extensions/browser`
- `//extensions/renderer`
- `streams_private`
- `pdf_viewer_private`
- MimeHandlerView / GuestView / PdfHost deps

Build verification:

- Baseline `autoninja -C chromium/src/out/Default libtermsurf_chromium` passed
  before changes.
- Final `autoninja -C chromium/src/out/Default libtermsurf_chromium` passed.
- `./scripts/build.sh roamium` passed.
- `libtermsurf_chromium_test` was not used as a pass/fail signal. It currently
  fails to link on the inherited branch because
  `content::TsNotifyTargetUrlChanged(void*, char const*)` is unresolved from
  `content::Shell::UpdateTargetURL(...)`. The Roamium startup probe gave the
  required evidence for this experiment.

Probe evidence appeared in Roamium/Wezboard logs:

```text
[issue-776-exp6] pdf resources registered=true count=12
[issue-776-exp6] pdf template replacements registered=true
[issue-776-exp6] pdf manifest parsed=true
[issue-776-exp6] pdf known resource resolved=true path=pdf/index.html id=21596
[issue-776-exp6] pdf extension id=mhjfbmdgcfjbbpaeojofohoefgiehjai pdf_mime=application/pdf internal_plugin_mime=application/x-google-chrome-pdf
[issue-776-exp6] browser resources pack loaded=true
[issue-776-exp6] pdf resource sample=pdf/browser_api.js
[issue-776-exp6] pdf resource sample=pdf/index.css
[issue-776-exp6] pdf resource sample=pdf/index.html
```

Automated smoke runs completed and captured screenshots:

- PDF fixture: `logs/issue-776-exp6-pdf-20260527-114611/pdf-smoke.png`
- HTML smoke: `logs/issue-776-exp6-html-20260527-114632/pdf-smoke.png`
- non-PDF binary smoke: `logs/issue-776-exp6-bin-20260527-114648/pdf-smoke.png`

Each screenshot artifact is a non-empty `4112 x 2658` PNG, and each run logged
the resource probe lines above. As expected, this experiment did not claim
visible PDF rendering.

The final `libtermsurf_chromium.dylib` size after the build was `14,781,856`
bytes. No pre-change size baseline was captured for this experiment.

The patch archive was regenerated under `chromium/patches/issue-776-exp6/`. The
archive contains the cumulative Issue 776 Chromium patch stack through
`0029-Register-PDF-viewer-resources.patch`.

#### Conclusion

TermSurf can now own the PDF viewer resource substrate directly: the generated
PDF viewer resources are buildable, the manifest is parseable, the extension id
and MIME metadata are available, and known viewer resource paths resolve without
enabling the general extension system.

The next experiment should move from static resource substrate to runtime
delivery. The likely next layer is either a minimal `chrome-extension://`
resource-serving bridge for the PDF extension id or the Electron-style stream
path around `PluginResponseInterceptorURLLoaderThrottle` and `streams_private`.
If Chromium refuses to serve the PDF viewer URL without an
`ExtensionsBrowserClient` component-resource manager hook, that exact object
should become the next experiment's scope.

### Experiment 7: Serve PDF Viewer Resources

#### Description

Experiment 6 proved that TermSurf can register and resolve the PDF viewer
component resources. The next missing layer is runtime delivery: Chromium must
be able to request the PDF viewer shell and receive real `pdf/index.html`,
`pdf/index.css`, and JavaScript bytes from TermSurf-owned code.

This experiment should prove only that viewer resources can be served through a
runtime URL path. It should not yet wire the original PDF byte stream into the
viewer, should not implement `streams_private`, and should not attempt to make a
PDF visibly render. A successful result means a navigation to a controlled
TermSurf PDF viewer resource URL displays a recognizable PDF viewer shell or
diagnostic sentinel loaded from the registered resources.

The preferred path is the narrowest one Chromium will accept:

1. Try a minimal `chrome-extension://mhjfbmdgcfjbbpaeojofohoefgiehjai/...`
   serving path for the PDF extension id, backed by
   `TsPdfComponentExtensionResourceManager`.
2. If Chromium requires
   `ExtensionsBrowserClient::GetComponentExtensionResourceManager()` before it
   will route that URL, add the smallest PDF-only browser-client bridge that
   returns the Experiment 6 resource manager.
3. If Chromium requires broader `ExtensionSystem`, `ExtensionRegistry`,
   GuestView, MimeHandlerView, or extension renderer machinery merely to serve a
   static PDF viewer resource, stop and mark the experiment Partial. Do not
   silently grow this experiment into the full Electron PDF stack.

This experiment is about the PDF viewer shell URL, not the PDF document stream.
If the viewer shell loads but reports that no PDF stream is available, that is a
Pass for Experiment 7.

#### Changes

1. Create a new Chromium branch.

   Branch from the current Issue 776 branch:

   ```bash
   git -C chromium/src checkout 148.0.7778.97-issue-776-exp6
   git -C chromium/src checkout -b 148.0.7778.97-issue-776-exp7
   ```

   Add the branch to `chromium/README.md`:

   > Issue 776 Experiment 7: serve PDF viewer resources.

2. Audit Chromium's static extension-resource serving path.

   Before implementation, inspect the resource-serving code that normally maps
   component-extension URLs to resource ids:

   ```bash
   rg "ComponentExtensionResourceManager|GetComponentExtensionResourceManager|chrome-extension" \
     chromium/src/extensions chromium/src/chrome chromium/src/content -n
   rg "URLLoaderFactory|URLDataSource|ExtensionURLLoaderFactory|ResourceRequestPolicy" \
     chromium/src/extensions chromium/src/chrome chromium/src/content -n
   ```

   Record in the result which hook actually owns static `chrome-extension://...`
   resource delivery in Chromium 148.

3. Add a runtime serving probe backed by the Experiment 6 resource manager.

   The serving path should:
   - recognize only `extension_misc::kPdfExtensionId`;
   - serve only paths present in `TsPdfComponentExtensionResourceManager`;
   - load bytes from `ui::ResourceBundle` using the resolved resource id;
   - apply the Experiment 6 template replacements where the resource is an HTML
     template that requires them;
   - return the correct MIME type for at least `.html`, `.css`, `.js`, and
     `.wasm`;
   - reject all other extension ids and unknown paths.

   Prefer implementing this through Chromium's existing extension-resource
   machinery. If that is too broad, implement a TermSurf-owned temporary URL
   handler whose URL shape makes the experiment explicit, for example:

   ```text
   termsurf-pdf-viewer://mhjfbmdgcfjbbpaeojofohoefgiehjai/pdf/index.html
   ```

   The temporary scheme is acceptable only if the result explains why the native
   `chrome-extension://` path requires broader extension infrastructure. The
   temporary scheme must be treated as a probe, not the final product design.

4. Add a direct debug navigation target for the viewer shell.

   Add a narrow way to navigate Roamium to the viewer shell URL without first
   loading a PDF document. Acceptable options:
   - a debug-only command-line switch such as `--termsurf-pdf-viewer-probe`;
   - a hard-coded probe URL used only by the existing
     `scripts/test-issue-776-pdf.sh` automation when an env var is set;
   - or a documented local URL typed by the automation.

   The loaded page should make success easy to classify. If raw `pdf/index.html`
   is visually blank until stream wiring exists, inject a small diagnostic
   sentinel outside the viewer bundle, such as:

   ```text
   TermSurf PDF viewer resources loaded
   ```

   The sentinel must prove the viewer resource delivery path ran. It must not be
   a fake PDF rendering page that bypasses the viewer resources.

5. Add low-volume diagnostics.

   Use a distinct prefix such as `[issue-776-exp7]`. Log:
   - requested resource URL;
   - resolved extension id;
   - resolved resource path;
   - resource id;
   - byte count served;
   - MIME type;
   - whether template replacements were applied;
   - whether the request was rejected and why.

   The logs may be unconditional for the experiment or gated by
   `TERMSURF_PDF_TRACE=1`.

6. Keep Experiment 7 scoped to static viewer resources.

   Do not implement:
   - `streams_private`;
   - `pdf_viewer_private`;
   - `PluginResponseInterceptorURLLoaderThrottle` redirect changes;
   - MimeHandlerView;
   - GuestView;
   - `PdfHost`;
   - PDF renderer process routing changes;
   - weakening or bypassing `CHECK(IsPdfRenderer())`;
   - fake HTML that merely says "PDF loaded" without fetching registered viewer
     resources.

   If any of those layers are required just to serve `pdf/index.html`, stop and
   record the exact missing layer.

7. Build Chromium and Roamium.

   ```bash
   autoninja -C chromium/src/out/Default libtermsurf_chromium
   ./scripts/build.sh roamium
   ```

8. Extend the automation only as much as needed to capture the viewer-resource
   probe.

   Reuse the existing screenshot automation from the PDF experiments. Add a
   probe mode if needed, for example:

   ```bash
   TERMSURF_PDF_TRACE=1 \
   TERMSURF_PDF_VIEWER_RESOURCE_PROBE=1 \
   LOG_DIR="$PWD/logs/issue-776-exp7-viewer-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)" \
   ./scripts/test-issue-776-pdf.sh
   ```

   The screenshot should include either the actual PDF viewer shell or the
   diagnostic sentinel proving the viewer resource-serving path ran.

9. Regenerate the Chromium patch archive if the experiment passes or produces a
   coherent Partial worth preserving.

   Use `chromium/patches/issue-776-exp7/`.

10. Record the result directly under this experiment.

    Include:
    - exact Chromium files changed;
    - exact BUILD.gn deps added;
    - whether the final probe used `chrome-extension://` or a temporary TermSurf
      scheme;
    - the resource-serving hook identified in step 2;
    - `[issue-776-exp7]` log lines for at least `pdf/index.html`;
    - screenshot artifact path;
    - whether the viewer shell loaded, displayed a no-stream error, or failed
      before rendering;
    - whether Experiment 8 should proceed to stream routing or to a missing
      extension-resource object.

11. Format this issue document:

    ```bash
    prettier --write --prose-wrap always --print-width 80 \
      issues/0776-pdf-not-loading/README.md
    ```

#### Non-Negotiable Invariants

- Experiment 6's resource manager remains the source of truth for PDF viewer
  resource path resolution.
- Unknown extension ids and unknown resource paths must not be served.
- Serving static viewer resources must not enable general user extension
  support.
- This experiment must not claim PDF rendering success unless an actual PDF page
  visibly renders in the screenshot.
- This experiment must not wire `streams_private`, MimeHandlerView, GuestView,
  or `PdfHost`.
- This experiment must not change the TermSurf protocol.
- This experiment must not close Issue 776.

#### Verification

1. Confirm branch and files:

   ```bash
   git -C chromium/src branch --show-current
   git -C chromium/src diff --name-only
   git diff --name-only
   ```

   Expected:
   - Chromium branch is `148.0.7778.97-issue-776-exp7`;
   - Chromium changes are limited to static PDF viewer resource serving and
     required BUILD.gn edits;
   - main repo changes are limited to `chromium/README.md`, this issue document,
     any automation update, and the regenerated patch archive.

2. Build:

   ```bash
   autoninja -C chromium/src/out/Default libtermsurf_chromium
   ./scripts/build.sh roamium
   ```

3. Run the viewer-resource probe with screenshots enabled.

   Capture:
   - screenshot artifact;
   - `wezboard-gui.log`;
   - Roamium/Chromium logs if separate.

   The screenshot must show either:
   - a visible PDF viewer shell loaded from the registered viewer resources; or
   - the explicit diagnostic sentinel proving the resource-serving path ran.

4. Confirm logs contain a successful resource delivery for at least:
   - `pdf/index.html`;
   - one stylesheet or JavaScript resource, if the viewer shell requested one.

   Expected log shape:

   ```text
   [issue-776-exp7] request url=...
   [issue-776-exp7] served extension_id=mhjfbmdgcfjbbpaeojofohoefgiehjai path=pdf/index.html id=... bytes=... mime=text/html
   ```

5. Confirm rejection behavior.

   Attempt one unknown resource path and one wrong extension id through the same
   serving path. The log must show rejection, and the browser must not receive a
   successful resource response.

6. Confirm normal browsing still works.

   Re-run the HTML smoke test against `https://example.com`.

7. Confirm ordinary PDF navigation behavior is not claimed as fixed.

   Load the vendored Bitcoin PDF through the existing automation. It may still
   show the current pre-rendering failure. Record the result, but do not treat
   this as a failure of Experiment 7 unless the new resource-serving code
   regresses the behavior from Experiment 6.

#### Pass Criteria

Pass if:

- Chromium builds;
- Roamium builds;
- the probe serves `pdf/index.html` from registered Experiment 6 resources;
- at least one screenshot proves the viewer-resource path reached the browser;
- logs show the PDF extension id, resource path, resource id, byte count, and
  MIME type;
- unknown extension ids and unknown paths are rejected;
- no stream routing, MimeHandlerView, GuestView, `PdfHost`, or general extension
  support is added.

This Pass does not require a PDF document to render. A viewer shell that loads
and then reports "missing stream" is a successful Experiment 7 outcome.

#### Partial Criteria

Partial if:

- TermSurf can serve resources only through a temporary `termsurf-pdf-viewer://`
  probe scheme, and Chromium refuses the native `chrome-extension://` route
  without broader extension infrastructure;
- Chromium requires an `ExtensionsBrowserClient` component-resource hook before
  static PDF viewer resources can be served;
- the viewer shell requests additional resources or security context that the
  PDF-only resource manager does not yet provide;
- resource serving works for `pdf/index.html` but not for dependent CSS/JS
  resources.

The result must name the exact missing object or hook and make that the next
experiment's scope.

#### Failure Criteria

- The experiment fakes success with a page that does not load registered PDF
  viewer resources.
- The experiment starts implementing the PDF stream path instead of static
  viewer resource delivery.
- The experiment broadens into general extension support without proving that a
  smaller PDF-only serving hook is impossible.
- The experiment weakens PDF renderer checks or globally marks ordinary
  renderers as PDF renderers.
- Unknown extension ids or unknown paths are served successfully.
- The result claims PDF rendering success from a static viewer-shell or
  diagnostic-sentinel screenshot.
