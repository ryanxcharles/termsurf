# Issue 414: Two Profiles via XPC

## Goal

Two browser profiles rendering side by side in one window at an uncompromising
60fps, each profile running in its own process, communicating via XPC with
IOSurface Mach port transfer. This is the architecture that TermSurf will ship.

## Background

### The multi-profile problem

Issue 413 proved the core constraint: two `BrowserContext` instances in one
Chromium process drop rendering to 2fps (Experiment 4), while two `WebContents`
sharing one `BrowserContext` render at 60fps side by side (Experiment 6). The
boundary is clear — one profile per process.

### Multi-process rendering is proven

Three prior efforts proved that cross-process rendering via IOSurface Mach port
transfer works on macOS:

| Effort                           | Result                        | Bottleneck                                         |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Issue 403** (Swift+Rust+C++)   | 60fps, <0.12ms composite time | None — architecture proven                         |
| **cef-test** (two CEF profiles)  | 50fps per profile             | CEF internal scheduling jitter (~15% vsync misses) |
| **ts3** (WezTerm + CEF profiles) | 38fps                         | Input pipeline + GUI rendering overhead            |

The cef-test result is the most relevant. Two independent CEF processes
rendering simultaneously achieved 50fps each with p50 = 16.7ms (exactly on
vsync). The ~10fps gap from 60fps is entirely due to CEF's
`do_message_loop_work()` jitter — not XPC, not IOSurface transfer, not
compositing. The Content API should eliminate this ceiling entirely.

### What we're building on

- **One Profile app** (Issue 412–413) — A Content Shell clone that renders at
  60fps. This becomes the basis for each profile server process.
- **cef-test** — Multi-process architecture with proven XPC protocol and
  IOSurface compositing. Port the frame delivery and compositing code, replace
  CEF with Content API, simplify bootstrap by eliminating the launcher.
- **termsurf-xpc** — Rust XPC bindings used by cef-test and ts3. Wraps
  `xpc_connection`, `xpc_dictionary`, Mach port transfer, IOSurface
  create/lookup.

## Branch

Create a new branch `146.0.7650.0-issue-414` in the `termsurf-chromium`
submodule, forked from `146.0.7650.0-issue-412` (the One Profile app). This
starts with a working Content Shell clone that renders at 60fps with a single
profile — the baseline from Issue 412. Each experiment is a commit on top.

```bash
cd ts4/termsurf-chromium/src
git checkout -b 146.0.7650.0-issue-414 146.0.7650.0-issue-412
```

We fork from Issue 412 (not Issue 413) because Issue 413 added multi-profile
experiments (second `BrowserContext`, second `WebContents`, side-by-side layout)
that we don't need here. Issue 414's experiments build new capture and XPC
machinery on top of a clean single-profile app.

## Architecture

```
Two Profiles GUI (Cocoa/Metal window + XPC Mach service)
├── Listens on com.termsurf.two-profiles
├── Spawns profile-a server → connects back to GUI
│   └── Left pane ◀── IOSurface Mach port ── Profile A server (Content API)
├── Spawns profile-b server → connects back to GUI
│   └── Right pane ◀── IOSurface Mach port ── Profile B server (Content API)
└── Composites both IOSurfaces into one window
```

Two process types (no launcher):

1. **GUI process** — Creates a single window with two Metal quads. Registers as
   a named XPC Mach service (`com.termsurf.two-profiles`). Spawns profile server
   processes as children, passing the service name and a session ID as CLI args.
   Receives IOSurface Mach ports from both profile servers via XPC. Imports each
   as a Metal texture and composites them side by side. No browser code runs
   here.

2. **Profile server process** (one per profile) — Runs the Content API with a
   single `BrowserContext`. Navigates a `WebContents` to the test page. Captures
   the composited output as an IOSurface. Connects to the GUI's Mach service by
   name and sends IOSurface Mach ports every frame.

### Why no launcher?

In cef-test and ts3, a separate launcher process acted as a middleman: the GUI
sent an anonymous XPC endpoint to the launcher, the launcher stored it, and the
profile server claimed it. This relay was necessary because XPC endpoints can
only be transferred over existing XPC connections — two processes with no shared
channel have no way to exchange endpoints.

The launcher solved the bootstrap problem, but it was a third process (~220
lines) that existed solely to relay one message per profile. A simpler
alternative: **make the GUI itself the named Mach service.** The GUI registers a
hard-coded service name (e.g., `com.termsurf.two-profiles`) via a launchd plist.
Profile servers receive this name as a CLI argument and connect directly. No
endpoint relay, no session claiming, no middleman.

The connection is bidirectional — once established, the profile server sends
IOSurface frames to the GUI, and the GUI sends input events (keyboard, mouse,
resize) back to the profile server over the same connection. This is the same
communication pattern as cef-test, just with one fewer process.

If the GUI-as-service approach hits problems (e.g., multiple GUI instances
conflicting on the service name), we can fall back to the launcher pattern. For
the PoC with a single window, the simpler approach should work.

### XPC protocol

**Bootstrap (simplified from cef-test):**

1. GUI registers as Mach service `com.termsurf.two-profiles` (via launchd plist)
2. GUI spawns profile-a server with args:
   `--service com.termsurf.two-profiles
   --session-id profile-a --profile profile-a --url <url>`
3. Profile-a server connects to `com.termsurf.two-profiles` by name
4. Profile-a server sends `register` message with its session ID
5. GUI maps the connection to the left pane
6. Repeat for profile-b (right pane)

No anonymous listeners, no endpoint relay, no claim handshake. Each profile
server connects directly to the GUI.

**Frame delivery (fast path, every frame):**

```
Profile server → GUI:
{
  action: "display_surface",
  iosurface_port: <mach_port_t>,  // set_mach_send()
  width: i64,                      // physical pixels
  height: i64,                     // physical pixels
}
```

**Input forwarding (GUI → profile server, same connection):**

```
GUI → Profile server:
{
  action: "key_event" | "mouse_click" | "mouse_move" | "resize" | ...,
  ... event-specific fields ...
}
```

**GUI import pipeline:**

1. `copy_mach_send("iosurface_port")` — extract Mach port from XPC message
2. `IOSurfaceLookupFromMachPort(port)` — reconstruct IOSurface in GUI process
3. Import as Metal texture
4. Composite into window
5. `mach_port_deallocate(port)` — release kernel resource

## Prior art: what to reuse

### From cef-test

cef-test used a three-process architecture (GUI, launcher, profile server) where
the launcher relayed XPC endpoints between the GUI and profile servers. We're
simplifying to two process types (GUI + profile servers) by making the GUI the
named Mach service, but the frame delivery and compositing code is directly
reusable:

- **Frame delivery protocol:** `display_surface` message with `iosurface_port`.
  One message per frame, ~100 bytes + Mach port. Identical to what we need.
- **GUI compositing:** wgpu render pipeline with two quads (left/right),
  IOSurface import via `IOSurfaceLookupFromMachPort`, sRGB texture views.
- **Background dispatch queue for XPC callbacks:** Critical discovery — XPC
  handlers must dispatch on a background queue, not the main queue, to avoid
  conflicts with the GUI event loop.
- **Benchmark harness:** 60-second automated run with frame interval statistics
  (avg fps, % at 60fps, p50/p95/p99, max consecutive streak).

### From termsurf-xpc

Reference implementation for the XPC patterns we need. The Rust code won't be
reused directly, but the patterns translate 1:1 to Apple's C API
(`<xpc/xpc.h>`):

- **Connection management:** `xpc_connection_create_mach_service()` for named
  services, `xpc_connection_set_event_handler()` for message dispatch.
- **Mach port transfer:** `xpc_dictionary_set_mach_send()` (sender) /
  `xpc_dictionary_copy_mach_send()` (receiver).
- **IOSurface sharing:** `IOSurfaceCreateMachPort()` (sender) /
  `IOSurfaceLookupFromMachPort()` (receiver) / `mach_port_deallocate()`
  (cleanup).

### From the One Profile app

- **Content API embedder:** Complete, buildable, 60fps Content Shell clone. This
  becomes the profile server with the addition of IOSurface capture and XPC
  frame delivery.
- **Profile path management:** `SHELL_DIR_USER_DATA` override for isolated
  profile storage. Each profile server process overrides to its own path.

## Language choice for the PoC

C++ for everything. Both the GUI and profile server are C++/Objective-C++.

- **Profile server:** C++. Links against Chromium. XPC calls use Apple's C API
  directly (`<xpc/xpc.h>`). Modified from the One Profile app.
- **GUI:** C++/Objective-C++. Metal rendering via Objective-C++
  (`<Metal/Metal.h>`, `<QuartzCore/QuartzCore.h>`). XPC Mach service
  registration via Apple's C API. IOSurface import via
  `<IOSurface/IOSurface.h>`.

This keeps the entire PoC in one language, avoids cross-language build
complexity, and matches Chromium's own codebase. The cef-test Rust code and
termsurf-xpc crate are useful as reference for the XPC protocol and IOSurface
transfer patterns, but the implementation will be native C++.

## How Electron captures GPU textures

Electron's off-screen rendering (OSR) solves the same problem we need to solve:
capture the composited output of a `WebContents` as a GPU texture, without
displaying it in a window. Studying Electron's approach reveals that Chromium
already has a built-in API for this.

### Two capture paths (GPU vs. software)

Electron has two capture paths, selected by whether GPU acceleration is enabled:

**GPU-accelerated (FrameSinkVideoCapturer):** When
`HardwareAccelerationEnabled()` returns true (the normal case), Electron creates
an `OffScreenVideoConsumer` backed by `ClientFrameSinkVideoCapturer`. This is
Chromium's built-in video capture API — the same mechanism Chrome uses for tab
capture, WebRTC screen sharing, and remote display. It issues
`CopyOutputRequest`s at the compositor level and delivers frames as
`GpuMemoryBufferHandle`s. On macOS, these handles are IOSurfaces.

**Software rasterization (HostDisplayClient):** When GPU acceleration is
disabled, Electron falls back to `OffScreenHostDisplayClient`. On macOS, this
receives `OnDisplayReceivedCALayerParams()` callbacks from Chromium's
compositor, which include `io_surface_mach_port`. This is the older, legacy
path.

The selection logic is straightforward (`osr_render_widget_host_view.cc`):

```cpp
if (content::GpuDataManager::GetInstance()->HardwareAccelerationEnabled()) {
  video_consumer_ = std::make_unique<OffScreenVideoConsumer>(...);
  video_consumer_->SetActive(is_painting());
} else {
  // Falls through to HostDisplayClient path
}
```

Only one path is active at a time. They are never used simultaneously.

### FrameSinkVideoCapturer: the GPU-accelerated path

This is the path that matters for TermSurf. GPU acceleration is not optional —
we need it for 60fps rendering.

How it works:

1. `CreateVideoCapturer()` on the `RenderWidgetHostView` creates a
   `ClientFrameSinkVideoCapturer` (host side) linked to a
   `FrameSinkVideoCapturerImpl` (renderer side)
2. Chromium's viz layer monitors frame damage and issues `CopyOutputRequest`s
3. Frames arrive in `OnFrameCaptured()` as `GpuMemoryBufferHandle`s
4. On macOS, the handle contains an IOSurface pointer
   (`OffscreenSharedTextureValue.shared_texture_handle`)
5. A buffer pool of 10 pre-allocated GPU textures eliminates per-frame
   allocation

Key properties:

- **Supported API.** Designed for continuous frame capture, not a hook into
  compositor internals.
- **Buffer pooling.** 10-frame ring buffer (`kFramePoolCapacity = 10`), no
  allocation per frame.
- **Frame rate control.** Built-in `SetMinCapturePeriod()`.
- **Damage tracking.** Only dirty regions flagged via `content_rect`.
- **Cross-platform.** IOSurface on macOS, D3D11 on Windows, DMA-BUF on Linux.

The tradeoff is that `CopyOutputRequest` involves a GPU-to-GPU copy — not true
zero-copy. But it's a GPU-side copy, fast enough for Chrome's real-time tab
capture.

### The `useSharedTexture` option

Within the FrameSinkVideoCapturer path, a separate `useSharedTexture` preference
controls the capture format:

- `true` → GPU shared texture (IOSurface on macOS). This is what we want.
- `false` → Shared memory bitmap (CPU-accessible pixels).

This preference does NOT select between the two capture paths — it only controls
the buffer format within the GPU-accelerated path.

### Why the CALayerParams path is irrelevant

The `OffScreenHostDisplayClient` / `OnDisplayReceivedCALayerParams()` path on
macOS is only active when GPU acceleration is disabled. Since TermSurf requires
GPU acceleration for 60fps rendering, this path is irrelevant to us. Early
research (before studying Electron's source) considered intercepting at
`DisplayCALayerTree::UpdateCALayerTree()` to grab
`CALayerParams.io_surface_mach_port`, but this is the wrong approach — it's the
software fallback, not the GPU-accelerated path.

### What this means for TermSurf

The profile server should use `FrameSinkVideoCapturer` to capture composited
frames as IOSurfaces, then create Mach ports from those IOSurfaces and send them
to the GUI via XPC. This is exactly what Electron does for its `paint` event
with `useSharedTexture = true`, except instead of delivering the texture to
JavaScript, we deliver the Mach port to a separate GUI process.

Key reference files:

- `electron/shell/browser/osr/osr_video_consumer.{h,cc}` — capture logic
- `electron/shell/browser/osr/osr_render_widget_host_view.{h,cc}` — OSR widget
- `electron/shell/browser/osr/osr_paint_event.h` — frame data structures
- `electron/shell/browser/osr/osr_host_display_client_mac.mm` — legacy macOS
  path (irrelevant but useful as reference)

## Ideas for Experiments

### Idea 1: FrameSinkVideoCapturer

**Goal:** Capture composited frames as IOSurfaces at 60fps using Chromium's
built-in video capture API.

Electron's off-screen rendering uses `ClientFrameSinkVideoCapturer`, which
implements `viz::mojom::FrameSinkVideoConsumer`. This is a Chromium API designed
for exactly this use case — capturing compositor output for headless rendering,
screen sharing, and remote display. Chrome uses it for tab capture and WebRTC.

How it works:

1. Call `CreateVideoCapturer()` on the `RenderWidgetHostView`
2. Chromium's viz layer issues `CopyOutputRequest`s at the compositor level
3. Frames arrive in `OnFrameCaptured()` as `GpuMemoryBufferHandle`s — which on
   macOS are IOSurfaces
4. A buffer pool of 10 pre-allocated GPU textures eliminates per-frame
   allocation

Advantages:

- **Supported API.** Designed for continuous capture, not a hook into internals.
- **Buffer pooling.** 10-frame ring buffer, no allocation per frame.
- **Frame rate control.** Built-in `SetMinCapturePeriod()`.
- **Damage tracking.** Only dirty regions flagged.
- **Cross-platform.** IOSurface on macOS, D3D11 on Windows, DMA-BUF on Linux.

Tradeoff: involves a `CopyOutputRequest` (GPU-to-GPU copy), so not true
zero-copy. But it's a GPU-side copy — fast enough for Chrome's real-time tab
capture at 60fps.

Reference: `electron/shell/browser/osr/osr_video_consumer.{h,cc}`.

### Idea 2: Single profile server with XPC frame delivery

**Goal:** Prove IOSurface Mach port transfer from a Content API process to a
separate GUI process works at 60fps.

Two components:

1. **GUI** (C++/ObjC++) — registers as Mach service `com.termsurf.two-profiles`,
   spawns profile server, receives Mach ports, imports as Metal textures,
   renders to window
2. **Profile server** (modified One Profile app, C++) — captures frames as
   IOSurfaces, connects to GUI's Mach service, sends Mach ports via XPC

This proves the full pipeline: Content API → IOSurface → Mach port → XPC → GPU
texture → window. If this hits 60fps, the architecture is validated.

### Idea 3: Two profile servers, one window

**Goal:** Two profiles, two processes, one window, both at 60fps.

Run two profile server instances (profile-a and profile-b) with the GUI
displaying both side by side. This is the target architecture — identical to
cef-test but with Content API instead of CEF.

Success criteria: both panes rendering the spinning blue square at 60fps with
different localStorage identities (proving profile isolation).

### Idea 4: Stress test and benchmarking

**Goal:** Sustained 60fps under load, matching or exceeding cef-test's 50fps.

Run the two-profile setup for 60+ seconds with continuous animation. Measure:

- Average FPS per profile
- Percentage of frames at 60fps (within one vsync interval)
- p50, p95, p99 frame intervals
- CPU usage (must not be 100%)
- Max consecutive frames at 60fps

Compare against cef-test's benchmark (50fps, 80.8% at 60fps, p50=16.7ms,
p95=33.6ms). The Content API should beat these numbers since CEF's internal
scheduling jitter was the bottleneck.

## Success criteria

- Two panes in one window, each showing the spinning blue square
- Different localStorage identity in each pane (profile isolation)
- Both at 60fps sustained for 60+ seconds
- CPU usage well below 100% (no busy-wait loops)
- IOSurface transfer via XPC (not shared memory, not window capture)

## What this unlocks

Once this PoC works, the path to TermSurf is clear:

1. **Ghostty integration:** Replace the Rust/Swift GUI with Ghostty's Metal
   renderer. Ghostty composites IOSurfaces from profile servers alongside
   terminal panes.
2. **Input forwarding:** GUI sends keyboard and mouse events to profile servers
   via XPC (reverse direction of the frame pipeline).
3. **Process lifecycle:** Ghostty manages profile server processes. Multiple
   `web` commands for the same profile reuse the existing process.
4. **Multiple WebContents per profile:** Each profile server handles multiple
   WebContents (tabs). Issue 413 Experiment 6 proved this works at 60fps.

## Experiments

### Experiment 1: Capture frames with FrameSinkVideoCapturer

#### Hypothesis

Chromium's `FrameSinkVideoCapturer` — the same API Electron uses for off-screen
rendering — can capture composited frames from a `WebContents` as IOSurfaces at
60fps. If this works, the profile server's capture mechanism is solved: each
frame is already an IOSurface, ready for Mach port transfer via XPC.

#### Background

Electron's GPU-accelerated OSR path uses `ClientFrameSinkVideoCapturer`, which
implements `viz::mojom::FrameSinkVideoConsumer`. The capturer attaches to a
`FrameSinkId` (identifying which compositor output to capture), issues
`CopyOutputRequest`s at the viz layer, and delivers frames as
`GpuMemoryBufferHandle`s. On macOS, these handles contain IOSurfaces.

The API is designed for continuous capture — Chrome uses it for tab capture,
WebRTC screen sharing, and remote display. It has a 10-frame buffer pool,
built-in frame rate control, and damage tracking.

Key reference: `electron/shell/browser/osr/osr_video_consumer.{h,cc}`.

#### Design

Working on the `146.0.7650.0-issue-414` branch (forked from Issue 412's One
Profile app), modify the app to attach a `FrameSinkVideoCapturer` to the first
`WebContents` and log every captured frame. The WebContents still renders
normally in its window — we're just tapping the compositor output.

##### Step 1: Create a video consumer class

Add a new file `shell_video_consumer.{h,cc}` in `content/one_profile/browser/`.
It implements `viz::mojom::FrameSinkVideoConsumer`:

```cpp
#include "components/viz/host/client_frame_sink_video_capturer.h"
#include "content/browser/compositor/surface_utils.h"
#include "content/public/browser/render_widget_host.h"
#include "content/public/browser/render_widget_host_view.h"
#include "content/public/browser/web_contents.h"
#include "services/viz/privileged/mojom/compositing/frame_sink_video_capture.mojom.h"

class ShellVideoConsumer : public viz::mojom::FrameSinkVideoConsumer {
 public:
  void Attach(content::WebContents* web_contents);

  // viz::mojom::FrameSinkVideoConsumer:
  void OnFrameCaptured(
      media::mojom::VideoBufferHandlePtr data,
      media::mojom::VideoFrameInfoPtr info,
      const gfx::Rect& content_rect,
      mojo::PendingRemote<viz::mojom::FrameSinkVideoConsumerFrameCallbacks>
          callbacks) override;
  void OnNewCaptureVersion(
      const media::CaptureVersion& capture_version) override {}
  void OnFrameWithEmptyRegionCapture() override {}
  void OnStopped() override {}
  void OnLog(const std::string& message) override {}

 private:
  std::unique_ptr<viz::ClientFrameSinkVideoCapturer> capturer_;
  int frame_count_ = 0;
  base::TimeTicks last_log_time_;
};
```

##### Step 2: Configure and start capture

In `Attach()`:

1. Get the `HostFrameSinkManager` via `content::GetHostFrameSinkManager()`
2. Create a capturer via `manager->CreateVideoCapturer()`
3. Configure: `SetFormat(media::PIXEL_FORMAT_ARGB)`,
   `SetMinCapturePeriod(base::Milliseconds(16))` (60fps),
   `SetAutoThrottlingEnabled(false)`
4. Get the `FrameSinkId` from the WebContents:
   `web_contents->GetRenderWidgetHostView()->GetRenderWidgetHost()->GetFrameSinkId()`
5. Set target:
   `capturer_->ChangeTarget(viz::VideoCaptureTarget(frame_sink_id), 0)`
6. Start:
   `capturer_->Start(this, viz::mojom::BufferFormatPreference::kPreferMappableSharedImage)`

The `kPreferMappableSharedImage` preference is what makes Chromium deliver
IOSurfaces (GPU memory buffers) instead of shared memory bitmaps.

##### Step 3: Handle captured frames

In `OnFrameCaptured()`:

1. Check `data->is_gpu_memory_buffer_handle()` — if false, log a warning (means
   we got shared memory instead of an IOSurface)
2. Extract the handle: `data->get_gpu_memory_buffer_handle()`
3. On macOS, the handle contains an IOSurface: `gmb_handle.io_surface().get()`
   returns an `IOSurfaceRef`
4. Log the IOSurface dimensions via `IOSurfaceGetWidth()` /
   `IOSurfaceGetHeight()`
5. Increment frame counter, log fps once per second
6. **Signal done immediately:** create a `mojo::Remote` from the `callbacks`
   pending remote and call `Done()`. This returns the buffer to the pool. If we
   don't call `Done()`, the 10-frame pool depletes and capture stalls.

##### Step 4: Wire it up

In `ShellBrowserMainParts::InitializeMessageLoopContext()`, after creating the
Shell and WebContents, create a `ShellVideoConsumer` and call
`Attach(web_contents)`. The consumer must outlive the WebContents — store it as
a member of `ShellBrowserMainParts`.

Note: the `RenderWidgetHostView` may not exist immediately after
`Shell::CreateNewWindow()`. If `GetRenderWidgetHostView()` returns null, defer
attachment. The simplest approach: post a delayed task (e.g., 1 second) to allow
navigation to complete. A production implementation would use
`WebContentsObserver::RenderViewReady()`, but for the PoC a delay is fine.

#### What we're modifying

- **New files:** `content/one_profile/browser/shell_video_consumer.{h,cc}`
- **Modified:** `content/one_profile/browser/shell_browser_main_parts.{h,cc}` —
  add `ShellVideoConsumer` member, wire up in `InitializeMessageLoopContext()`
- **Modified:** `content/one_profile/BUILD.gn` — add new source files

No changes to Chromium's own code. Everything uses public Content API +
`content/browser/compositor/surface_utils.h` (internal but stable).

#### Expected result

Log output showing 60 captured frames per second, each with an IOSurface of the
correct dimensions (e.g., 1200×1200 physical pixels for a 600×600 logical view
at 2x Retina). The window still displays normally — we're capturing alongside
the regular rendering path.

```
[INFO] Frame 1: 1200x1200 IOSurface (gpu_memory_buffer)
[INFO] Frame 2: 1200x1200 IOSurface (gpu_memory_buffer)
...
[INFO] 60 frames in last 1.00s (60.0 fps)
```

#### What a failure would mean

- **`is_gpu_memory_buffer_handle()` returns false:** We got shared memory
  instead of an IOSurface. Check that `kPreferMappableSharedImage` was passed to
  `Start()`, and that GPU acceleration is enabled (no `--disable-gpu` flag).
- **0 frames:** The capturer didn't attach to the right `FrameSinkId`, or the
  `RenderWidgetHostView` wasn't ready. Check timing and frame sink resolution.
- **< 60fps:** The `CopyOutputRequest` overhead is significant, or
  auto-throttling is still enabled. Try `SetAutoThrottlingEnabled(false)` and
  `SetMinCapturePeriod(base::TimeDelta())` (unlimited).
- **Crash in `io_surface()`:** The `GpuMemoryBufferHandle` type on macOS doesn't
  use IOSurface in this build configuration. Investigate the handle type and
  platform-specific extraction.

#### Result: PASSED

`FrameSinkVideoCapturer` delivers IOSurfaces at a rock-solid 60fps. Every frame
arrives as a `gpu_memory_buffer_handle` containing a valid IOSurface.

```
[ShellVideoConsumer] Attached to FrameSinkId FrameSinkId(5, 3), starting capture
[ShellVideoConsumer] 61 frames in 1.0047s (60.7144 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
[ShellVideoConsumer] 60 frames in 1.00019s (59.9889 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
[ShellVideoConsumer] 61 frames in 1.0165s (60.0097 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
[ShellVideoConsumer] 61 frames in 1.0167s (59.9982 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
[ShellVideoConsumer] 60 frames in 1.00249s (59.8507 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
[ShellVideoConsumer] 61 frames in 1.01447s (60.1299 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
[ShellVideoConsumer] 61 frames in 1.01616s (60.0299 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
[ShellVideoConsumer] 60 frames in 1.00022s (59.9868 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
[ShellVideoConsumer] 60 frames in 1.00013s (59.992 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
[ShellVideoConsumer] 61 frames in 1.0166s (60.0041 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
[ShellVideoConsumer] 60 frames in 1.00004s (59.9974 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
[ShellVideoConsumer] 61 frames in 1.0164s (60.0155 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
```

Key observations:

- **60fps sustained.** Every 1-second interval reports exactly 60 or 61 frames.
  No drops, no jitter.
- **IOSurfaces, not shared memory.** Every frame arrived as a
  `gpu_memory_buffer_handle`. The `kPreferMappableSharedImage` preference worked
  as expected.
- **640x360 IOSurface.** This matches the window's content view size. The
  capturer respects the actual rendered resolution.
- **No impact on windowed rendering.** The page renders normally in its window
  while the capturer taps the compositor output in parallel.
- **2-second delayed attach worked.** The `RenderWidgetHostView` was available
  by the time the delayed task fired.

This proves the capture mechanism for the profile server. Each frame is already
an IOSurface — ready for `IOSurfaceCreateMachPort()` and XPC transfer to the GUI
process.

### Experiment 2: XPC frame delivery to a receiver process

#### Hypothesis

IOSurface Mach ports created from `FrameSinkVideoCapturer` frames can be
transferred via XPC to a separate process and reconstructed at 60fps. This
proves the critical link in the architecture: the profile server's captured
IOSurfaces can cross process boundaries without GPU-to-CPU readback.

#### Background

Experiment 1 proved that `FrameSinkVideoCapturer` delivers IOSurfaces at 60fps.
The next step is to verify that these IOSurfaces — which are allocated by
Chromium's GPU process — support `IOSurfaceCreateMachPort()` for cross-process
transfer. This is not guaranteed; the IOSurface must be backed by a kernel
object accessible to other processes.

The XPC transfer pattern is well-established from cef-test and ts3: the sender
calls `IOSurfaceCreateMachPort()` on the IOSurface, embeds the port in an XPC
dictionary via `xpc_dictionary_set_mach_send()`, and sends it. The receiver
calls `xpc_dictionary_copy_mach_send()` to extract the port, then
`IOSurfaceLookupFromMachPort()` to reconstruct the IOSurface. Both sides call
`mach_port_deallocate()` to avoid leaking kernel resources.

Key reference: `ts3/cef-test-profile/src/main.rs` (Mach port creation and send),
`ts3/cef-test-gui/src/main.rs` (Mach port receive and IOSurface import),
`ts3/termsurf-xpc/src/iosurface.rs` (IOSurface Mach port API wrappers).

#### Design

Two binaries, communicating via XPC:

1. **Profile server** — The One Profile app from Experiment 1, modified to
   create Mach ports from captured IOSurfaces and send them via XPC. Keeps its
   window — useful for debugging, and headless mode is a separate concern.
2. **Receiver** — A minimal standalone Objective-C program that receives
   IOSurface Mach ports via XPC and logs their dimensions and frame rate. No
   Metal rendering — this just proves the transfer works. Rendering is a
   separate experiment.

##### Step 1: Build the receiver

Create `ts4/two-profiles-receiver/main.m`, a standalone Objective-C program
(~100 lines). It runs as an XPC Mach service listener:

1. Call
   `xpc_connection_create_mach_service("com.termsurf.two-profiles", queue, XPC_CONNECTION_MACH_SERVICE_LISTENER)`
   to register as a listener on the Mach service name.
2. Set a new-connection handler. For each incoming connection, set an event
   handler that processes `display_surface` messages:
   ```c
   mach_port_t port = xpc_dictionary_copy_mach_send(msg, "iosurface_port");
   IOSurfaceRef surface = IOSurfaceLookupFromMachPort(port);
   size_t w = IOSurfaceGetWidth(surface);
   size_t h = IOSurfaceGetHeight(surface);
   // Log dimensions, increment frame counter, log FPS once per second
   CFRelease(surface);
   mach_port_deallocate(mach_task_self(), port);
   ```
3. Run the dispatch loop with `dispatch_main()`.

Build with:

```bash
clang -framework Foundation -framework IOSurface -o receiver main.m
```

##### Step 2: Register the Mach service

Create a launchd agent plist
(`ts4/two-profiles-receiver/com.termsurf.two-profiles.plist`) that registers the
`com.termsurf.two-profiles` Mach service name. This is required —
`xpc_connection_create_mach_service` with the listener flag only works for
launchd-registered services.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"
  "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.termsurf.two-profiles</string>
    <key>MachServices</key>
    <dict>
        <key>com.termsurf.two-profiles</key>
        <true/>
    </dict>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/Users/ryan/dev/termsurf/ts4/two-profiles-receiver/receiver</string>

    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
    <string>/Users/ryan/dev/termsurf/logs/two-profiles-receiver.log</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Load with:

```bash
launchctl load ~/dev/termsurf/ts4/two-profiles-receiver/com.termsurf.two-profiles.plist
```

Unload with:

```bash
launchctl unload ~/dev/termsurf/ts4/two-profiles-receiver/com.termsurf.two-profiles.plist
```

When the profile server connects to the service name, launchd starts the
receiver on demand. Output goes to
`/Users/ryan/dev/termsurf/logs/two-profiles-receiver.log`.

For interactive debugging, skip the plist and run:

```bash
launchctl debug gui/com.termsurf.two-profiles -- $(pwd)/ts4/two-profiles-receiver/receiver
```

##### Step 3: Modify the profile server

Extend `ShellVideoConsumer` to send captured IOSurfaces via XPC:

**XPC connection.** Add a `ConnectToService(const std::string& name)` method:

```cpp
#include <xpc/xpc.h>

void ShellVideoConsumer::ConnectToService(const std::string& name) {
  xpc_connection_ = xpc_connection_create_mach_service(
      name.c_str(), nullptr, 0);  // Client mode (no listener flag)
  xpc_connection_set_event_handler(xpc_connection_, ^(xpc_object_t event) {
    if (xpc_get_type(event) == XPC_TYPE_ERROR) {
      LOG(ERROR) << "[ShellVideoConsumer] XPC error";
    }
  });
  xpc_connection_resume(xpc_connection_);
  LOG(INFO) << "[ShellVideoConsumer] Connected to XPC service: " << name;
}
```

**Mach port send.** In `OnFrameCaptured()`, after extracting the IOSurface:

```cpp
if (xpc_connection_) {
  mach_port_t port = IOSurfaceCreateMachPort(io_surface);
  if (port != MACH_PORT_NULL) {
    xpc_object_t msg = xpc_dictionary_create(NULL, NULL, 0);
    xpc_dictionary_set_string(msg, "action", "display_surface");
    xpc_dictionary_set_mach_send(msg, "iosurface_port", port);
    xpc_dictionary_set_int64(msg, "width", (int64_t)width);
    xpc_dictionary_set_int64(msg, "height", (int64_t)height);
    xpc_connection_send_message(xpc_connection_, msg);  // Async, no reply
    xpc_release(msg);
    mach_port_deallocate(mach_task_self(), port);
  }
}
```

`xpc_connection_send_message` is fire-and-forget — it returns immediately after
queuing the message. The Mach port send right is copied into the XPC message, so
we deallocate our copy after sending.

**CLI flag.** Add `--xpc-service <name>` to the One Profile app. Parse it in
`ShellBrowserMainParts::InitializeMessageLoopContext()` and pass to the video
consumer's `ConnectToService()` before calling `Attach()`.

##### Step 4: Run and verify

1. `cd ts4/box-demo && bun run server.ts` — Start the test page
2. The receiver starts automatically via launchd when the profile server
   connects, or use `launchctl debug` for interactive mode
3. Start the profile server:
   ```bash
   out/Default/One\ Profile.app/Contents/MacOS/One\ Profile \
     --xpc-service com.termsurf.two-profiles \
     http://localhost:9407 2>&1
   ```
4. Check receiver output:
   `tail -f /Users/ryan/dev/termsurf/logs/two-profiles-receiver.log`

#### What we're creating

- `ts4/two-profiles-receiver/main.m` — Receiver program (standalone ObjC)
- `ts4/two-profiles-receiver/com.termsurf.two-profiles.plist` — Launchd agent
- `ts4/two-profiles-receiver/Makefile` — Build script

#### What we're modifying

- `content/one_profile/browser/shell_video_consumer.{h,cc}` — Add XPC client
  connection, Mach port creation/send in `OnFrameCaptured()`
- `content/one_profile/browser/shell_browser_main_parts.cc` — Parse
  `--xpc-service` flag, call `ConnectToService()` before `Attach()`
- `content/one_profile/BUILD.gn` — May need additional framework deps (XPC is
  part of libSystem so likely no changes)

#### Expected result

Receiver logs showing 60 IOSurface reconstructions per second:

```
[Receiver] Profile server connected
[Receiver] 60 frames in 1.00s (60.0 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
[Receiver] 61 frames in 1.02s (59.8 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
[Receiver] 60 frames in 1.00s (60.0 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
```

Profile server logs showing Mach port sends alongside the existing capture logs
from Experiment 1.

#### What a failure would mean

- **`IOSurfaceCreateMachPort()` returns `MACH_PORT_NULL`:** The IOSurfaces from
  `FrameSinkVideoCapturer` don't support Mach port creation. This would mean
  Chromium allocates them in a way that prevents cross-process sharing. Check
  whether the `GpuMemoryBufferHandle` carries an IOSurface that's backed by a
  real kernel object (not a process-local mapping).
- **`IOSurfaceLookupFromMachPort()` returns NULL:** The Mach port arrived but
  the IOSurface can't be reconstructed. Verify that `copy_mach_send` (not
  `get_mach_send`) is used on the receive side. Check that
  `mach_port_deallocate` isn't called before lookup.
- **< 60fps in receiver:** XPC message overhead is significant. Measure
  per-message latency. The cef-test benchmark showed XPC overhead was negligible
  (~0.1ms per message), so this would be surprising.
- **Launchd won't start the receiver:** Plist syntax error or wrong binary path.
  Check `launchctl list | grep termsurf` and
  `launchctl print gui/com.termsurf.two-profiles`.
- **Profile server can't connect:** The Mach service name isn't registered yet.
  Add retry with exponential backoff (100ms initial, 10 attempts) to
  `ConnectToService()`.

#### Result: PASSED

IOSurface Mach port transfer from the Content API profile server to a separate
receiver process works at a rock-solid 60fps. Every frame's IOSurface crosses
the process boundary intact.

Receiver output:

```
[Receiver] Starting XPC Mach service listener: com.termsurf.two-profiles

```

Profile server output (concurrent with receiver):

```

[ShellVideoConsumer] Attached to FrameSinkId FrameSinkId(5, 3), starting capture
[ShellVideoConsumer] 60 frames in 1.00135s (59.9192 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
[ShellVideoConsumer] 61 frames in 1.01663s (60.0023 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
[ShellVideoConsumer] 60 frames in 1.00042s (59.9746 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
[ShellVideoConsumer] 61 frames in 1.01887s (59.87 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
[ShellVideoConsumer] 61 frames in 1.01384s (60.1676 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
[ShellVideoConsumer] 60 frames in 1.00056s (59.9667 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
```

Key observations:

- **60fps sustained in the receiver.** Every interval reports 60-61 frames. The
  initial burst of 73 frames is expected — the first interval includes buffered
  frames from startup.
- **IOSurfaceCreateMachPort() works.** Chromium's GPU-allocated IOSurfaces
  support Mach port creation. No NULL ports, no failures.
- **IOSurfaceLookupFromMachPort() works.** Every Mach port reconstructs into a
  valid 640x360 IOSurface in the receiver process.
- **XPC overhead is negligible.** Both sender and receiver report identical fps,
  confirming that XPC message delivery adds no measurable latency.
- **Launchd on-demand launch works.** The receiver started automatically when
  the profile server first connected to the Mach service name.
- **CLI flag gotcha.** Chromium's `CommandLine` requires `=` syntax for switch
  values: `--xpc-service=com.termsurf.two-profiles` (not space-separated).

This proves the full pipeline: Content API → FrameSinkVideoCapturer → IOSurface
→ Mach port → XPC → IOSurface reconstruction in a separate process, all at 60fps
with zero frame drops.

#### Conclusion

Experiments 1 and 2 together prove the two hardest unknowns in the architecture:

1. **Experiment 1** proved that Chromium's `FrameSinkVideoCapturer` delivers
   composited frames as IOSurfaces at 60fps — solving the capture problem.
2. **Experiment 2** proved that those IOSurfaces cross process boundaries via
   XPC Mach port transfer at 60fps with no degradation — solving the delivery
   problem.

What remains is integration work, not research:

- **Experiment 3** (Idea 3): Run two profile server processes simultaneously,
  each with its own `BrowserContext`, both sending frames to a single GUI that
  composites them side by side in one window. This is the target architecture.
- **Experiment 4** (Idea 4): Stress test and benchmark the two-profile setup
  against cef-test's results (50fps, 80.8% at 60fps).

There are no more architectural risks. The Content API captures at 60fps, the
IOSurfaces support Mach port creation, and XPC delivers them to another process
without measurable overhead. Every component in the pipeline is proven.

### Experiment 3: Hidden sender, visible receiver

#### Hypothesis

A hidden (windowless) profile server can capture and send IOSurface frames via
XPC to a separate receiver process that renders them as Metal textures in a
visible window at 60fps. This inverts the Experiment 2 topology — the window
the user sees belongs to the receiver, not the sender.

#### Background

In Experiments 1 and 2, the profile server displayed its own window. The
receiver was invisible (logging only). But in TermSurf's target architecture,
the GUI process owns the window and the profile servers are headless background
processes. This experiment proves that inversion works:

1. **Hidden sender.** The profile server runs without a visible window. The
   `FrameSinkVideoCapturer` must still capture frames when the window is hidden.
   If macOS throttles the compositor for hidden windows, we need to know now.
2. **Visible receiver.** The receiver renders received IOSurfaces as Metal
   textures in a window. This proves the GPU texture import path:
   `IOSurfaceLookupFromMachPort()` → `newTextureWithDescriptor:iosurface:plane:`
   → Metal render pass → screen.

This is a single-profile test. Two profiles side by side is the next experiment.

#### Design

Two processes:

1. **Profile server** — The One Profile app with a new `--hidden` flag that
   hides the window after creation. Still captures via `FrameSinkVideoCapturer`
   and sends IOSurface Mach ports via XPC (unchanged from Experiment 2).
2. **Receiver** (`ts4/two-profiles-receiver/`) — Replace the current log-only
   receiver with an Objective-C++ program that creates a Metal window and
   renders each received IOSurface as a fullscreen textured quad.

##### Step 1: Add `--hidden` flag to the profile server

Add a `--hidden` switch to `shell_switches.h`. In the macOS platform delegate,
after the window is created, hide it:

```cpp
// In shell_platform_delegate_mac.mm, after window creation:
if (base::CommandLine::ForCurrentProcess()->HasSwitch(switches::kHidden)) {
  [shell->window() orderOut:nil];
}
```

`orderOut:nil` removes the window from the screen without closing it. The
compositor and `FrameSinkVideoCapturer` should continue running because the
`WebContents` and its `RenderWidgetHostView` are still alive.

If `orderOut:` causes macOS to throttle or pause the compositor, try
`[shell->window() setAlphaValue:0]` (invisible but on-screen) or
`[NSApp setActivationPolicy:NSApplicationActivationPolicyAccessory]` (no dock
icon, no menu bar) as alternatives.

##### Step 2: Build the Metal receiver

Replace `ts4/two-profiles-receiver/main.m` with `main.mm` (Objective-C++) that
renders received IOSurfaces in a Metal window. The program does three things:

**a) XPC Mach service listener.** Same as the current receiver — listen on
`com.termsurf.two-profiles`, handle `display_surface` messages. When a frame
arrives:

```objc
mach_port_t port = xpc_dictionary_copy_mach_send(msg, "iosurface_port");
IOSurfaceRef surface = IOSurfaceLookupFromMachPort(port);
// Store surface + dimensions in shared state (protected by lock or atomic swap)
mach_port_deallocate(mach_task_self(), port);
```

Store the latest IOSurface in a shared variable. The render loop reads it. Old
IOSurfaces are released when replaced.

**b) Metal window.** Create an `NSWindow` with a `CAMetalLayer`-backed
`NSView`:

```objc
CAMetalLayer *metalLayer = [CAMetalLayer layer];
metalLayer.device = MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice();
metalLayer.pixelFormat = MTLPixelFormatBGRA8Unorm;
metalLayer.framebufferOnly = NO;
[view setWantsLayer:YES];
[view setLayer:metalLayer];
```

Window size: 640x360 (matching the IOSurface dimensions from Experiment 2).

**c) Metal render pipeline.** A single fullscreen textured quad:

- **Vertex data:** Four vertices forming a triangle strip covering the entire
  NDC range ([-1,-1] to [+1,+1]) with texture coords [0,0] to [1,1].
- **Vertex shader:** Passthrough — position and texcoord.
- **Fragment shader:** Sample the texture at the interpolated texcoord.
- **Texture creation from IOSurface:**
  ```objc
  MTLTextureDescriptor *desc = [MTLTextureDescriptor
      texture2DDescriptorWithPixelFormat:MTLPixelFormatBGRA8Unorm
      width:IOSurfaceGetWidth(surface)
      height:IOSurfaceGetHeight(surface)
      mipmapped:NO];
  desc.usage = MTLTextureUsageShaderRead;
  id<MTLTexture> texture = [device
      newTextureWithDescriptor:desc
      iosurface:surface
      plane:0];
  ```

**d) Render loop.** Use `CVDisplayLink` to drive rendering at vsync:

1. Check if a new IOSurface is available (atomic swap or lock).
2. If so, create a new `MTLTexture` from it. Release the old texture.
3. If a texture exists, begin a render pass: clear to black, draw the fullscreen
   quad with the texture, present the drawable.
4. Log fps once per second.

If no IOSurface has arrived yet, render a black frame.

##### Step 3: Metal shader file

Create `ts4/two-profiles-receiver/shaders.metal`:

```metal
#include <metal_stdlib>
using namespace metal;

struct VertexOut {
    float4 position [[position]];
    float2 texcoord;
};

vertex VertexOut vertex_main(uint vid [[vertex_id]]) {
    // Fullscreen triangle strip: 4 vertices
    float2 positions[4] = {
        float2(-1, -1), float2(1, -1),
        float2(-1,  1), float2(1,  1)
    };
    float2 texcoords[4] = {
        float2(0, 1), float2(1, 1),
        float2(0, 0), float2(1, 0)
    };
    VertexOut out;
    out.position = float4(positions[vid], 0, 1);
    out.texcoord = texcoords[vid];
    return out;
}

fragment float4 fragment_main(VertexOut in [[stage_in]],
                               texture2d<float> tex [[texture(0)]],
                               sampler samp [[sampler(0)]]) {
    return tex.sample(samp, in.texcoord);
}
```

No vertex buffer needed — the vertex shader generates positions from
`vertex_id`. This eliminates buffer management for the PoC.

##### Step 4: Build

Update the Makefile to compile Objective-C++ with Metal:

```makefile
all: receiver shaders.metallib

receiver: main.mm
	clang++ -std=c++17 -framework Foundation -framework IOSurface \
	  -framework Metal -framework QuartzCore -framework AppKit \
	  -framework CoreVideo -o receiver main.mm

shaders.metallib: shaders.metal
	xcrun -sdk macosx metal -c shaders.metal -o shaders.air
	xcrun -sdk macosx metallib shaders.air -o shaders.metallib
	rm -f shaders.air

clean:
	rm -f receiver shaders.metallib shaders.air
```

##### Step 5: Run and verify

1. `cd ts4/box-demo && bun run server.ts` — Start the test page
2. Load the launchd plist (if not already loaded):
   ```bash
   launchctl load ~/dev/termsurf/ts4/two-profiles-receiver/com.termsurf.two-profiles.plist
   ```
3. Start the profile server (hidden):
   ```bash
   cd ~/dev/termsurf/ts4/termsurf-chromium/src
   out/Default/One\ Profile.app/Contents/MacOS/One\ Profile \
     --hidden --xpc-service=com.termsurf.two-profiles \
     http://localhost:9407 2>&1
   ```
4. The receiver starts automatically via launchd when the profile server
   connects.
5. Verify:
   - The receiver window shows the spinning blue square
   - No profile server window is visible
   - Receiver logs 60fps in `~/dev/termsurf/logs/two-profiles-receiver.log`
   - Profile server logs 60fps capture (same as Experiments 1 and 2)

#### What we're creating

- `ts4/two-profiles-receiver/main.mm` — Metal receiver (replaces `main.m`)
- `ts4/two-profiles-receiver/shaders.metal` — Vertex + fragment shaders

#### What we're modifying

- `ts4/two-profiles-receiver/Makefile` — Updated for Objective-C++ and Metal
  shader compilation
- `content/one_profile/common/shell_switches.h` — Add `kHidden` switch
- `content/one_profile/browser/shell_platform_delegate_mac.mm` — Hide window
  when `--hidden` is passed

#### Expected result

The receiver window shows the spinning blue square, rendered from an IOSurface
received via XPC. No sender window is visible. Both processes report 60fps.

```
Profile server (hidden)          Receiver (visible)

│  ports           │            │  Metal window    │
└──────────────────┘            └──────────────────┘
```

#### What a failure would mean

- **0fps from hidden sender:** macOS throttles or pauses the compositor for
  hidden windows. Try alternatives: `setAlphaValue:0` (invisible but on-screen),
  `NSApplicationActivationPolicyAccessory` (background app), or Chromium's
  `--disable-backgrounding-occluded-windows` flag.
- **IOSurface renders as black or garbled:** The texture format doesn't match.
  Check that `MTLPixelFormatBGRA8Unorm` matches the IOSurface pixel format. CEF
  used BGRA8888 — Chromium's `FrameSinkVideoCapturer` should be the same.
  Also check sRGB: if the IOSurface is sRGB, use `MTLPixelFormatBGRA8Unorm_sRGB`
  for the texture view (the cef-test GUI had this exact bug).
- **Receiver crashes on `newTextureWithDescriptor:iosurface:`:** The IOSurface
  dimensions don't match the texture descriptor. Use `IOSurfaceGetWidth()` and
  `IOSurfaceGetHeight()` from the actual surface, not the XPC message values.
- **< 60fps in receiver:** `CVDisplayLink` callback is too slow. Profile the
  texture creation and render pass. Both should be <1ms.
- **Tearing:** `CAMetalLayer` isn't presenting at vsync. Ensure
  `displaySyncEnabled = YES` on the layer (default is YES).

#### Result: FAILED

The hidden sender works perfectly — `FrameSinkVideoCapturer` sustains 60fps with
the window hidden via `orderOut:nil`. However, the receiver window opened blank.
No frames were ever rendered because the XPC connection died immediately after
being established.

Receiver log:

```
[Receiver] Listening on com.termsurf.two-profiles...
[Receiver] Profile server connected
[Receiver] Connection closed
[Receiver] Window and Metal pipeline ready
```

Profile server log:

```
[ShellVideoConsumer] Connected to XPC service: com.termsurf.two-profiles
[ShellVideoConsumer] Attached to FrameSinkId FrameSinkId(5, 3), starting capture
[ShellVideoConsumer] XPC connection interrupted
[ShellVideoConsumer] 61 frames in 1.01s (60.28 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
[ShellVideoConsumer] 60 frames in 1.00s (60.00 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
... (continues at 60fps indefinitely, sending into a dead connection)
```

The sequence of events:

1. Profile server launches and calls
   `xpc_connection_create_mach_service("com.termsurf.two-profiles", ...)`
2. Launchd starts the receiver on-demand to service the connection
3. Receiver's `applicationDidFinishLaunching:` runs: creates window, sets up
   Metal, starts XPC listener, starts CVDisplayLink
4. XPC listener fires on its background dispatch queue — "Profile server
   connected"
5. The peer connection is immediately invalidated — "Connection closed"
6. Back on the main thread, CVDisplayLink starts — "Window and Metal pipeline
   ready"
7. Profile server sees "XPC connection interrupted", but
   `FrameSinkVideoCapturer` keeps delivering IOSurfaces at 60fps. The capture
   pipeline is healthy; there's just nowhere to send the frames.
8. Receiver window is black — it never received a single IOSurface.

#### Conclusion

**What passed:**

- **Hidden sender at 60fps.** The `--hidden` flag works. `[window orderOut:nil]`
  hides the window and `FrameSinkVideoCapturer` continues capturing at a
  rock-solid 60fps. macOS does not throttle the compositor for hidden windows.
  This is a key finding — it means profile server processes can be truly headless
  background processes.

**What failed:**

- **XPC connection dies on arrival.** The peer connection from the profile server
  is invalidated immediately after being established. The receiver never receives
  a single `display_surface` message.

**Root cause analysis:**

The most likely cause is an XPC peer connection retention issue. The receiver
compiles with `-fobjc-arc`, and on modern macOS SDKs, XPC objects are
Objective-C objects managed by ARC. In the listener's event handler block, the
`peer` connection is cast and used but never stored in a strong reference outside
the block. When the event handler block returns, ARC may release the peer,
causing the connection to be invalidated.

In Experiment 2's log-only receiver (compiled as plain C with
`-framework Foundation`), this wasn't an issue because XPC objects were managed
via manual retain/release, and the XPC runtime's internal references kept the
connection alive. The switch to Objective-C++ with ARC changed the memory
management semantics for XPC objects.

An alternative explanation: the initialization order matters. The Metal setup
happens on the main thread while the XPC connection arrives on a background
dispatch queue. If `NSApplication`'s event loop isn't fully running when the
connection fires, the connection lifecycle might be disrupted. The logs show
"Connection closed" before "Window and Metal pipeline ready", confirming the
timing overlap.

**What we learned:**

1. `orderOut:nil` is the correct way to hide the sender window — 60fps capture
   is unaffected.
2. XPC peer connections need explicit retention in ARC environments. The
   Experiment 2 receiver (plain C, `dispatch_main()`) avoided this because it
   didn't use ARC.
3. Launchd on-demand launch introduces timing complexity when the launched
   process has a heavyweight initialization path (NSApplication + Metal +
   CVDisplayLink). The XPC connection arrives before the process is fully ready.

**Possible fixes for the next attempt:**

1. **Store the peer connection in a global.** Assign the peer to a `static
   xpc_connection_t` (or `__strong` Objective-C variable) so ARC doesn't release
   it when the event handler block returns.
2. **Start the XPC listener before `[NSApp run]`.** Move `start_xpc_listener()`
   to `main()` before entering the NSApplication event loop. The XPC listener
   runs on its own dispatch queue and doesn't need NSApplication.
3. **Compile without ARC for XPC code.** Use `-fno-objc-arc` or isolate the XPC
   code in a plain C file to avoid ARC interference with XPC object lifetimes.
4. **Use `dispatch_main()` instead of `[NSApp run]`.** Drive the Metal rendering
   from a dispatch source (e.g., `dispatch_source_create` with a timer) instead
   of CVDisplayLink + NSApplication. This matches the Experiment 2 receiver's
   architecture and avoids the NSApplication initialization race entirely.

### Experiment 4: Fix receiver XPC retention

#### Hypothesis

Experiment 3 failed because ARC released the XPC listener and peer connections
when their local variables went out of scope. Storing them as static globals and
restructuring initialization order will fix the blank window.

#### Background

Comparing the working Experiment 2 receiver with the failing Experiment 3
receiver reveals the exact root cause:

**Experiment 2 (works):** Plain Objective-C (`main.m`). The `xpc_connection_t
listener` is a local variable in `main()`. After setup, `main()` calls
`dispatch_main()`, which never returns. The local variable lives forever on the
stack. ARC never releases it. The listener stays alive, and all peer connections
delivered through it stay alive.

**Experiment 3 (fails):** Objective-C++ (`main.mm`, `-fobjc-arc`). The
`xpc_connection_t listener` is a local variable in `start_xpc_listener()`. This
function returns immediately after `xpc_connection_resume()`. ARC releases the
listener when the local goes out of scope. The listener dies, which invalidates
all peer connections — including the one that just connected. This is why the log
shows "Profile server connected" → "Connection closed" in rapid succession.

The peer connection has the same problem. In the listener's event handler block,
the `peer` parameter is used (cast, configured, resumed) but never stored. The
block captures it, but the block itself is ephemeral — it fires once per incoming
connection and then the captured reference goes away.

The fix is mechanical: store the listener and peer connection(s) as `static`
globals so ARC cannot release them.

#### Design

Two changes to the Experiment 3 receiver (`ts4/two-profiles-receiver/main.mm`):

##### Fix 1: Store the listener and peer as statics

Add static globals for the XPC objects:

```cpp
static xpc_connection_t g_listener = nil;
static xpc_connection_t g_peer = nil;  // single profile for now
```

In `start_xpc_listener()`, assign to `g_listener` instead of a local:

```cpp
g_listener = xpc_connection_create_mach_service(
    "com.termsurf.two-profiles", queue,
    XPC_CONNECTION_MACH_SERVICE_LISTENER);
```

In the listener's event handler, store the peer:

```cpp
xpc_connection_set_event_handler(g_listener, ^(xpc_object_t peer) {
    if (xpc_get_type(peer) == XPC_TYPE_CONNECTION) {
        g_peer = (xpc_connection_t)peer;  // ARC retains via static
        xpc_connection_set_event_handler(g_peer, ^(xpc_object_t event) {
            // ... same message handling as before ...
        });
        xpc_connection_resume(g_peer);
    }
});
```

This is the minimum change. The listener persists because `g_listener` holds a
strong reference. The peer persists because `g_peer` holds a strong reference.
ARC manages the retain/release automatically — we just need the globals to exist.

##### Fix 2: Start XPC listener before `[NSApp run]`

Move the `start_xpc_listener()` call from `applicationDidFinishLaunching:` to
`main()`, before `[app run]`:

```cpp
int main(int argc, const char *argv[]) {
    @autoreleasepool {
        start_xpc_listener();  // Ready for connections immediately
        NSApplication *app = [NSApplication sharedApplication];
        // ... rest of setup ...
        [app run];
    }
}
```

The XPC listener runs on its own serial dispatch queue — it doesn't need
NSApplication. Starting it in `main()` means the listener is ready the instant
launchd launches the process. The Metal window, CVDisplayLink, and everything
else can initialize later in `applicationDidFinishLaunching:`. Frames will queue
up in the mutex-protected `g_pending_surface` until the render loop starts.

This also eliminates the timing issue from Experiment 3 where "Connection closed"
fired before "Window and Metal pipeline ready". The connection can now be
established and start receiving frames while Metal initializes on the main
thread.

#### What we're modifying

- `ts4/two-profiles-receiver/main.mm` — Add static globals for XPC connections,
  move `start_xpc_listener()` to `main()`. No other changes.

No changes to the profile server, shaders, Makefile, or plist. The sender side
worked perfectly in Experiment 3.

#### Run and verify

Same procedure as Experiment 3:

1. `cd ts4/box-demo && bun run server.ts`
2. Reload the launchd plist (kill any stale receiver):
   ```bash
   launchctl unload ~/dev/termsurf/ts4/two-profiles-receiver/com.termsurf.two-profiles.plist
   cd ~/dev/termsurf/ts4/two-profiles-receiver && make
   launchctl load ~/dev/termsurf/ts4/two-profiles-receiver/com.termsurf.two-profiles.plist
   ```
3. Start the hidden profile server:
   ```bash
   cd ~/dev/termsurf/ts4/termsurf-chromium/src
   out/Default/One\ Profile.app/Contents/MacOS/One\ Profile \
     --hidden --xpc-service=com.termsurf.two-profiles \
     http://localhost:9407 2>&1
   ```
4. Verify:
   - Receiver window shows the spinning blue square
   - No profile server window visible
   - `tail -f ~/dev/termsurf/logs/two-profiles-receiver.log` shows 60fps
   - Profile server logs show 60fps capture and no "XPC connection interrupted"

#### Expected result

The receiver window shows the spinning blue square rendered from IOSurfaces
received via XPC. Both processes sustain 60fps. The receiver log shows:

```
[Receiver] Listening on com.termsurf.two-profiles...
[Receiver] Profile server connected
[Receiver] 60 frames in 1.00s (60.0 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
[Receiver] 61 frames in 1.02s (60.0 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
...
```

No "Connection closed" message. The profile server log shows capture and send
without "XPC connection interrupted".

#### What a failure would mean

- **Same "Connection closed" immediately:** The retention fix didn't help. The
  issue might be deeper — e.g., launchd delivers the connection before
  `xpc_connection_resume()` on the listener, and the connection is rejected.
  Try adding a retry in the profile server: if the connection is interrupted,
  wait 500ms and reconnect.
- **Receiver gets frames but window is black:** The XPC fix worked but Metal
  rendering has a bug. Check that `g_pending_surface` is being set (add a log
  in `handle_message`), that `render_frame()` is being called (add a log in the
  CVDisplayLink callback), and that the texture format matches.
- **Receiver gets frames but image is garbled/wrong colors:** Pixel format
  mismatch. Try `MTLPixelFormatBGRA8Unorm_sRGB` instead of
  `MTLPixelFormatBGRA8Unorm` (cef-test had this exact sRGB double-correction
  bug).

#### Result: PASSED

The spinning blue square renders at 60fps in the receiver window. No sender
window is visible. The full pipeline works: hidden Chromium process → IOSurface
capture → Mach port → XPC → IOSurface reconstruction → Metal texture → screen.

Receiver log:

```
[Receiver] Listening on com.termsurf.two-profiles...
[Receiver] Profile server connected
[Receiver] Window and Metal pipeline ready
[Receiver] 72 frames in 1.00s (71.9 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
[Receiver] 60 frames in 1.00s (60.0 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
[Receiver] 61 frames in 1.02s (60.0 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
[Receiver] 61 frames in 1.02s (60.0 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
[Receiver] 60 frames in 1.00s (60.0 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
[Receiver] 60 frames in 1.00s (60.0 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
[Receiver] 61 frames in 1.02s (60.0 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
[Receiver] 60 frames in 1.00s (60.0 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
```

Profile server log (hidden, no window):

```
[ShellVideoConsumer] Connected to XPC service: com.termsurf.two-profiles
[ShellVideoConsumer] Attached to FrameSinkId FrameSinkId(5, 3), starting capture
[ShellVideoConsumer] 61 frames in 1.00457s (60.7227 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
[ShellVideoConsumer] 60 frames in 1.00015s (59.9909 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
[ShellVideoConsumer] 61 frames in 1.01622s (60.0265 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
[ShellVideoConsumer] 60 frames in 1.00049s (59.9709 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
[ShellVideoConsumer] 61 frames in 1.01692s (59.9852 fps) | IOSurface 640x360
```

Key observations:

- **60fps sustained in both processes.** Receiver and sender both report 60fps
  across 60+ seconds with no drops.
- **No "Connection closed".** The XPC connection stays alive for the entire run.
  The static globals (`g_listener`, `g_peer`) prevent ARC from releasing the
  connections.
- **No "XPC connection interrupted" at startup.** The one "interrupted" message
  at line 27 of the sender log occurred ~23 seconds in (during a plist reload,
  not at startup) and had no effect on frame delivery — frames continued at
  60fps before and after.
- **Metal rendering works.** The IOSurface → MTLTexture →
  `newTextureWithDescriptor:iosurface:plane:` path renders correctly. No color
  issues — `MTLPixelFormatBGRA8Unorm` matches Chromium's IOSurface format.
- **Reconnection works.** The receiver log shows two successful sessions (the
  plist was reloaded mid-test). Both sessions established and sustained 60fps.
- **XPC listener in `main()` works.** Starting the listener before `[NSApp run]`
  means it's ready instantly when launchd delivers the connection. Frames queue
  up in `g_pending_surface` until the Metal pipeline starts.
- **Hidden sender confirmed again.** `[window orderOut:nil]` produces no visible
  window and does not throttle capture. Consistent with Experiment 3's finding.

#### Conclusion

Experiment 4 fixes Experiment 3's failure and completes the proof that a hidden
Chromium profile server can render to a separate Metal window at 60fps via XPC.

The root cause of Experiment 3's failure was confirmed: ARC released the XPC
listener and peer connections when `start_xpc_listener()` returned. The fix was
two lines — store both in static globals. Moving the XPC listener to `main()`
(before `[NSApp run]`) eliminated the initialization race as well.

The full pipeline is now proven end-to-end:

1. **Capture** (Experiment 1): `FrameSinkVideoCapturer` → IOSurface at 60fps
2. **Transfer** (Experiment 2): IOSurface → Mach port → XPC → IOSurface at 60fps
3. **Hidden sender** (Experiment 3 partial): `orderOut:nil` → 60fps, no
   throttling
4. **Visible receiver** (Experiment 4): IOSurface → MTLTexture → Metal render →
   screen at 60fps

What remains is running two profile servers simultaneously into one window with
side-by-side compositing — the target architecture.

### Experiment 5: Fix Retina rendering

#### Hypothesis

The receiver window is blurry because both sides of the pipeline operate at 1x
logical pixels instead of 2x physical pixels. Fixing the sender to capture at
physical resolution and the receiver to render at the screen's backing scale
factor will produce crisp Retina output.

#### Background

Experiment 4's receiver window was visibly blurry on a Retina (2x) display. The
logs show `IOSurface 640x360` — the logical pixel size of the sender's window.
On a 2x Retina screen, the IOSurface should be 1280x720 physical pixels.

Investigation of the Chromium source tree reveals two independent problems:

**Problem 1: The capturer has no resolution constraints.**

In `shell_video_consumer.cc`, the `FrameSinkVideoCapturer` is created with:

```cpp
capturer_->SetFormat(media::PIXEL_FORMAT_ARGB);
capturer_->SetMinCapturePeriod(base::Milliseconds(16));
capturer_->SetAutoThrottlingEnabled(false);
```

But `SetResolutionConstraints()` is never called. Without constraints, the
capturer's internal oracle defaults to the frame sink's logical (DIP) size —
640x360 on a Retina screen — not the physical pixel size (1280x720). The
compositor renders at 2x internally, but the capturer downscales to DIPs.

The API exists and is straightforward:

```cpp
capturer_->SetResolutionConstraints(
    gfx::Size(physical_width, physical_height),  // min
    gfx::Size(physical_width, physical_height),  // max
    /*use_fixed_aspect_ratio=*/false);
```

Setting min = max forces the capturer to produce IOSurfaces at exactly the
specified resolution. The physical dimensions come from the `WebContents` view
size multiplied by the device scale factor.

Note: Chromium also has a `SetScaleOverrideForCapture()` mechanism on
`RenderWidgetHostViewBase` that multiplies the device_scale_factor for HiDPI
capture mode. This is designed for capturing at *higher* than native resolution.
Since we just want native Retina resolution (not super-resolution), setting
explicit resolution constraints is the simpler and more direct fix.

**Problem 2: The receiver's CAMetalLayer renders at 1x.**

`CAMetalLayer.contentsScale` defaults to `1.0`. On a 2x Retina screen, Metal
renders a 640x360 drawable and macOS stretches it 2x to fill the 1280x720
backing store — a guaranteed blur. The fix is setting `contentsScale` to the
screen's `backingScaleFactor` and `drawableSize` to physical pixel dimensions.

Both problems must be fixed together. Without the sender fix, we'd have a 2x
drawable stretching a 1x source texture. Without the receiver fix, we'd have a
1x drawable downscaling a 2x source texture. Both are blurry.

#### Design

Two changes:

##### Fix 1: Sender — set resolution constraints on the capturer

In `shell_video_consumer.cc`, after creating the capturer and before calling
`Start()`, compute the physical pixel dimensions and set resolution constraints:

```cpp
// Get the view's size in physical pixels for Retina-correct capture.
auto* view = web_contents->GetRenderWidgetHostView();
gfx::Size view_size = view->GetVisibleViewportSize();  // logical (DIP)
float scale = view->GetDeviceScaleFactor();
gfx::Size physical_size(
    static_cast<int>(std::ceil(view_size.width() * scale)),
    static_cast<int>(std::ceil(view_size.height() * scale)));

capturer_->SetResolutionConstraints(
    physical_size, physical_size, /*use_fixed_aspect_ratio=*/false);
```

Using `std::ceil()` for the logical-to-physical conversion, per the lesson from
Issue 311 (truncation of odd logical dimensions loses a pixel).

After this fix, the IOSurface should be 1280x720 on a 2x Retina display (for a
640x360 logical window), and the log should show:

```
[ShellVideoConsumer] ... | IOSurface 1280x720
```

##### Fix 2: Receiver — set CAMetalLayer contentsScale

In `setup_metal()` in `main.mm`, after creating the `CAMetalLayer`, set the
scale and drawable size:

```objc
CGFloat scale = [[NSScreen mainScreen] backingScaleFactor];
g_metal_layer.contentsScale = scale;

CGSize viewSize = view.bounds.size;
g_metal_layer.drawableSize = CGSizeMake(
    viewSize.width * scale,
    viewSize.height * scale);
```

This tells Metal to render at 2x physical resolution. The drawable is now
1280x720 pixels for a 640x360 logical window. The IOSurface texture (also
1280x720 after Fix 1) maps 1:1 to the drawable — no stretching, no blur.

#### What we're modifying

- `content/one_profile/browser/shell_video_consumer.cc` — Add
  `SetResolutionConstraints()` call with physical pixel dimensions
- `ts4/two-profiles-receiver/main.mm` — Set `contentsScale` and `drawableSize`
  in `setup_metal()`

No changes to shaders, Makefile, plist, or the `--hidden` flag.

#### Run and verify

Same procedure as Experiment 4:

1. `cd ts4/box-demo && bun run server.ts`
2. Rebuild both binaries:
   ```bash
   cd ~/dev/termsurf/ts4/termsurf-chromium/src
   export PATH="$(cd ../depot_tools && pwd):$PATH"
   autoninja -C out/Default one_profile

   cd ~/dev/termsurf/ts4/two-profiles-receiver && make
   ```
3. Reload the launchd plist:
   ```bash
   launchctl unload ~/dev/termsurf/ts4/two-profiles-receiver/com.termsurf.two-profiles.plist
   launchctl load ~/dev/termsurf/ts4/two-profiles-receiver/com.termsurf.two-profiles.plist
   ```
4. Start the hidden profile server:
   ```bash
   cd ~/dev/termsurf/ts4/termsurf-chromium/src
   out/Default/One\ Profile.app/Contents/MacOS/One\ Profile \
     --hidden --xpc-service=com.termsurf.two-profiles \
     http://localhost:9407 2>&1
   ```
5. Verify:
   - Profile server logs: `IOSurface 1280x720` (not 640x360)
   - Receiver logs: `IOSurface 1280x720`
   - Receiver window: spinning blue square with crisp edges, no blur
   - Both processes at 60fps

#### Expected result

Both sender and receiver operate at 2x physical resolution. The IOSurface is
1280x720 (double the 640x360 logical window). The receiver renders the texture
1:1 into its 2x Metal drawable. The spinning blue square has crisp, sharp edges.

```
Profile server:  IOSurface 1280x720  (was 640x360)
Receiver:        IOSurface 1280x720  (was 640x360)
```

#### What a failure would mean

- **IOSurface still 640x360 after Fix 1:** `GetVisibleViewportSize()` or
  `GetDeviceScaleFactor()` returns unexpected values in the delayed-attach
  context. Log both values to debug. Try hardcoding `gfx::Size(1280, 720)` as a
  sanity check. If hardcoding works, the issue is in how we read the view's
  properties.
- **IOSurface is 1280x720 but receiver still blurry:** The `contentsScale` fix
  didn't take effect. Verify that `drawableSize` is being set *after* the layer
  is attached to the view. Log `g_metal_layer.contentsScale` and
  `g_metal_layer.drawableSize` to confirm.
- **Colors wrong or washed out:** sRGB double-correction (same bug as cef-test).
  The IOSurface is sRGB but the Metal texture descriptor specifies linear. Use
  `MTLPixelFormatBGRA8Unorm_sRGB` for the texture created from the IOSurface.
- **< 60fps:** Capturing at 2x resolution (4x the pixel count) may increase
  GPU load. Check if the profile server maintains 60fps at 1280x720. If not,
  try `SetAutoThrottlingEnabled(true)` or reduce the window size.

#### Result: FAILED

The `SetResolutionConstraints()` fix worked — IOSurfaces are now 1600x1200
physical pixels (800x600 logical × 2x Retina), up from 640x360. The receiver's
`contentsScale` fix also took effect. Both processes sustain 60fps. However, the
rendered output is still visibly blurry compared to Chrome rendering the same
page directly.

Receiver log:

```
[Receiver] Listening on com.termsurf.two-profiles...
[Receiver] Profile server connected
[Receiver] Window and Metal pipeline ready
[Receiver] 74 frames in 1.01s (73.0 fps) | IOSurface 1600x1200

[Receiver] 60 frames in 1.00s (60.0 fps) | IOSurface 1600x1200
```

Profile server log:

```

[ShellVideoConsumer] Attached to FrameSinkId FrameSinkId(5, 3), starting capture
[ShellVideoConsumer] 61 frames in 1.01142s (60.3114 fps) | IOSurface 1600x1200
[ShellVideoConsumer] 61 frames in 1.01692s (59.985 fps) | IOSurface 1600x1200
[ShellVideoConsumer] 61 frames in 1.01666s (60.0002 fps) | IOSurface 1600x1200
```

#### Conclusion

**What improved:**

- **IOSurface resolution doubled.** From 640x360 to 1600x1200 (4x the pixel
  count). `SetResolutionConstraints()` with physical pixel dimensions works as
  expected.
- **Receiver renders at Retina scale.** `contentsScale = 2.0` and `drawableSize`
  set to physical pixels. Metal is producing a 2x drawable.
- **60fps maintained.** No performance impact from 4x the pixel count.

**What failed:**

- **Still blurry compared to Chrome.** Side-by-side comparison with Chrome
  rendering the same page shows visibly softer text and edges in the receiver
  window.
- **Texture scales with window resize.** Resizing the receiver window stretches
  the texture instead of requesting new content at the correct size. No dynamic
  resize handling exists.

**Root cause analysis:**

Two problems remain:

1. **Size mismatch between source and receiver.** The sender's Content Shell
   window is 800x600 logical (1600x1200 physical), but the receiver window is
   640x360 logical (1280x720 physical). The 1600x1200 IOSurface is being
   sampled and rendered into a 1280x720 drawable — a non-integer downscale that
   introduces bilinear filtering blur. For pixel-perfect rendering, the source
   and destination must be the same size (1:1 pixel mapping).

2. **No resize coordination.** The receiver window size is hardcoded at creation.
   There's no mechanism to tell the sender what resolution to capture at, or to
   update the receiver's drawable when the window is resized. In the target
   architecture, the GUI sends resize messages to the profile server, which
   adjusts its `WebContents` size accordingly.

3. **Possible additional issues:**
   - The `CopyOutputRequest` in `FrameSinkVideoCapturer` may introduce subtle
     quality loss compared to Chrome's direct `CALayer` presentation path.
   - sRGB handling: the IOSurface may be sRGB-encoded but the Metal texture
     descriptor specifies `MTLPixelFormatBGRA8Unorm` (linear), potentially
     causing subtle color/contrast differences that make text appear softer.
   - The sampler uses bilinear filtering (`MTLSamplerMinMagFilterLinear`), which
     blurs when source and destination sizes don't match exactly.

**What we learned:**

1. `SetResolutionConstraints()` is the correct way to get Retina-resolution
   IOSurfaces from `FrameSinkVideoCapturer`. Without it, the capturer defaults
   to DIP (logical pixel) resolution.
2. `CAMetalLayer.contentsScale` must be set to `backingScaleFactor` for Retina
   rendering. The default of 1.0 causes upscaling blur.
3. Pixel-perfect rendering requires 1:1 size matching between the source
   IOSurface and the receiver drawable. Any scaling — even downscaling — causes
   visible blur from bilinear filtering.

**Fixes for the next attempt:**

1. **Match sizes.** Set the receiver window to the same logical size as the
   sender's Content Shell window (800x600), or set the sender's window size to
   match the receiver (640x360). The IOSurface dimensions and drawable dimensions
   must be identical.
2. **Try nearest-neighbor sampling.** Use `MTLSamplerMinMagFilterNearest` instead
   of linear to see if the blur is purely from the size mismatch (nearest won't
   blur but will show aliasing if sizes differ).
3. **Try sRGB texture format.** Use `MTLPixelFormatBGRA8Unorm_sRGB` for the
   Metal texture created from the IOSurface. This was the exact fix for the
   cef-test sRGB double-correction bug.
4. **Add resize coordination.** When the receiver window resizes, send the new
   dimensions to the sender, which adjusts its `WebContents` size and capturer
   resolution constraints accordingly.

### Experiment 6: Match window sizes for pixel-perfect rendering

#### Hypothesis

The remaining blur is caused by a size mismatch between the source IOSurface
(1600x1200 physical) and the receiver drawable (1280x720 physical). Setting the
receiver window to 800x600 logical — matching the sender's Content Shell default
— will produce a 1:1 pixel mapping and eliminate the blur entirely.

#### Background

Experiment 5 fixed the resolution from 1x to 2x on both sides, but the sender
and receiver windows have different logical sizes:

| Component         | Logical     | Physical (2x Retina) |
| ----------------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
| Sender (One Profile) | 800×600  | 1600×1200            |
| Receiver (Exp 5)  | 640×360     | 1280×720             |

The 1600×1200 IOSurface is sampled by bilinear filtering into a 1280×720
drawable. This is a non-integer downscale (0.8× horizontally, 0.6× vertically)
— every destination pixel samples a weighted average of multiple source pixels,
producing blur. No sampler configuration can avoid this; the data is being
destroyed by the downscale.

The Content Shell window defaults to 800×600 DIP (defined by
`kDefaultTestWindowWidthDip` and `kDefaultTestWindowHeightDip` in `shell.cc`,
configurable via `--content-shell-host-window-size`). The receiver must match
this size exactly.

A secondary concern is sRGB color space handling. Chromium's compositor likely
outputs sRGB-encoded pixel data, but the receiver creates Metal textures with
`MTLPixelFormatBGRA8Unorm` (no color space awareness). If Metal and the display
pipeline interpret these bytes differently, text and edges may appear subtly
softer. The cef-test project had this exact bug (documented in Issue 200):
textures declared as linear when the data was sRGB caused "washed out" colors.

#### Design

Two changes to the receiver, no changes to the sender:

##### Fix 1: Match receiver window size to sender

Change the window creation in `applicationDidFinishLaunching:`:

```objc
// Before (Experiment 5):
NSRect frame = NSMakeRect(100, 100, 640, 360);

// After:
NSRect frame = NSMakeRect(100, 100, 800, 600);
```

With `contentsScale = 2.0`, this produces a 1600×1200 drawable — exactly
matching the 1600×1200 IOSurface from the sender. Every source pixel maps to
exactly one destination pixel. No scaling, no filtering, no blur.

##### Fix 2: Use sRGB pixel format

Change all three pixel format declarations in the receiver to sRGB:

**a) CAMetalLayer pixel format** (in `setup_metal()`):
```objc
g_metal_layer.pixelFormat = MTLPixelFormatBGRA8Unorm_sRGB;
```

**b) IOSurface texture descriptor** (in `render_frame()`):
```objc
MTLTextureDescriptor *desc = [MTLTextureDescriptor
    texture2DDescriptorWithPixelFormat:MTLPixelFormatBGRA8Unorm_sRGB
    ...];
```

**c) Render pipeline color attachment** (in `setup_metal()`):
```objc
pipelineDesc.colorAttachments[0].pixelFormat = MTLPixelFormatBGRA8Unorm_sRGB;
```

All three must use the same format. With `_sRGB`:
- Metal decodes sRGB→linear when sampling the IOSurface texture in the fragment
  shader
- Metal encodes linear→sRGB when writing to the drawable
- The net effect is a no-op on the values (sRGB→linear→sRGB), but it tells
  macOS's display pipeline that the framebuffer is sRGB, ensuring correct
  rendering

If Chromium's IOSurfaces are already raw linear data (not sRGB-encoded), this
format declaration will apply an unwanted gamma curve — making colors too bright.
If that happens, revert to `MTLPixelFormatBGRA8Unorm`. The size fix alone may be
sufficient.

#### What we're modifying

- `ts4/two-profiles-receiver/main.mm`:
  - Window size: 640×360 → 800×600
  - Pixel format: `MTLPixelFormatBGRA8Unorm` → `MTLPixelFormatBGRA8Unorm_sRGB`
    (layer, texture, pipeline)

No changes to the sender, shaders, Makefile, or plist.

#### Run and verify

Same procedure as Experiment 5:

1. `cd ts4/box-demo && bun run server.ts`
2. Rebuild the receiver:
   ```bash
   cd ~/dev/termsurf/ts4/two-profiles-receiver && make
   ```
3. Reload the launchd plist:
   ```bash
   launchctl unload ~/dev/termsurf/ts4/two-profiles-receiver/com.termsurf.two-profiles.plist
   launchctl load ~/dev/termsurf/ts4/two-profiles-receiver/com.termsurf.two-profiles.plist
   ```
4. Start the hidden profile server:
   ```bash
   cd ~/dev/termsurf/ts4/termsurf-chromium/src
   out/Default/One\ Profile.app/Contents/MacOS/One\ Profile \
     --hidden --xpc-service=com.termsurf.two-profiles \
     http://localhost:9407 2>&1
   ```
5. Verify:
   - Receiver logs: `IOSurface 1600x1200` (same as Experiment 5)
   - Receiver window: 800×600 logical, crisp text and edges
   - Side-by-side comparison with Chrome at 800×600 — quality should be
     indistinguishable
   - Both processes at 60fps
   - If colors look wrong (too bright/washed), revert the sRGB change and test
     with `MTLPixelFormatBGRA8Unorm` only

#### Expected result

The receiver window shows the spinning blue square with pixel-perfect quality
matching Chrome. The 1600×1200 IOSurface maps 1:1 to the 1600×1200 drawable —
no scaling, no filtering artifacts.

```
Sender (800×600 logical)     Receiver (800×600 logical)
IOSurface 1600×1200    ──►   Drawable 1600×1200
                              1:1 pixel mapping
                              No blur
```

#### What a failure would mean

- **Still blurry with matching sizes:** The blur isn't from scaling. Investigate
  whether `FrameSinkVideoCapturer`'s `CopyOutputRequest` introduces quality loss
  compared to Chrome's direct `CALayer` compositing path. Try
  `SetScaleOverrideForCapture()` on the `RenderWidgetHostView` to capture at 3×
  or 4× and compare.
- **Colors too bright / washed out with sRGB:** Chromium's IOSurfaces are not
  sRGB-encoded (or Metal handles sRGB differently than expected). Revert to
  `MTLPixelFormatBGRA8Unorm` — the size fix alone should resolve the blur.
- **Correct colors but subtle softness:** The bilinear sampler is still
  interpolating due to floating-point texture coordinate imprecision. Try
  `MTLSamplerMinMagFilterNearest` as a diagnostic — if nearest looks identical
  to linear, the coordinates are precise and the softness has another cause.
