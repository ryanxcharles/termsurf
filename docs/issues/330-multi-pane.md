# 330: Multi-Webview Connection Bug

Closing one webview causes the profile server to exit, making other webviews in
the same profile inactive.

## Status

**Resolved.** Fixed by experiment 3 (idempotent error handler).

## Problem

When two webviews are open in the same profile and one is closed, the profile
server exits even though the other webview should still be active. This causes
the remaining webview to become inactive (no longer receives frames).

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. Open a terminal
2. Run `web google.com` in pane 0
3. Split pane (Ctrl+Shift+E or similar)
4. Run `web google.com` in pane 1
5. Close pane 1's webview (Ctrl+C twice)
6. Observe: pane 0's webview becomes inactive

**Expected behavior:** Closing one webview should not affect other webviews in
the same profile. The profile server should remain running as long as at least
one webview is active.

## Background

The profile server tracks GUI connections with a counter:

```rust
static GUI_CONNECTION_COUNT: AtomicUsize = AtomicUsize::new(0);
```

When a connection is established, the count increments. When a connection closes
(error received), the count decrements. When the count reaches 0, the profile
server exits gracefully.

The launcher has profile reuse logic — when a second `web` command uses the same
profile as an existing profile server, the launcher forwards a `create_browser`
command to the existing server instead of spawning a new one.

## Observed Behavior

**Profile server logs:**

```
Profile: GUI connection established (total: 1)
Profile: GUI connection established (total: 2)
Profile: GUI disconnected (remaining: 1)
Profile: GUI disconnected (remaining: 0)
Profile: No more GUI connections, exiting gracefully
```

Both connections disconnect when only one webview is closed.

**GUI logs:**

```
13:23:15.279  [XPC-CONN] Stored connection for pane 0: 0x865940030
13:23:21.690  [XPC-CONN] Stored connection for pane 1: 0x8670b2810
13:23:27.279  [Webview] Ctrl+C in Control mode → Exit browser
13:23:27.279  [XPC] Removed connection for pane 1
13:23:27.279  [XPC] Removed invalidate callback for pane 1
13:23:27.279  ERROR [XPC Manager] Connection error: XPC connection invalid
13:23:27.279  [Webview] Closed webview for pane 1
```

The GUI correctly tracks separate connections for each pane, but an "XPC
connection invalid" error appears immediately after removing pane 1's
connection.

## Analysis

The GUI side properly maintains separate connections per pane:

- `peer_connections: HashMap<PaneId, Arc<XpcConnection>>`
- Each webview has its own connection stored by pane ID
- Removing one pane's connection should only affect that connection

The profile server also creates separate connections per browser:

- Each `create_browser_on_ui_thread` call creates a new `XpcConnection`
- Each connection has its own event handler that decrements the count on error

However, when one connection is dropped on the GUI side, both connections on the
profile server side appear to receive disconnect errors.

### Possible Causes

1. **XPC connection sharing** — The XPC library might share some state between
   connections created from endpoints on the same anonymous listener.

2. **Listener cleanup** — The GUI stores listeners in a `Vec<XpcListener>` but
   never removes them. When one webview closes, its listener might still be
   active, causing issues.

3. **macOS XPC behavior** — Closing one connection might invalidate the
   underlying Mach port in a way that affects other connections from the same
   process.

4. **Profile server browser cleanup** — When one browser's GUI connection
   closes, CEF or the browser cleanup code might be affecting the whole process.

## Experiments

### Experiment 1: Diagnostic Logging

**Goal:** Add detailed connection identifiers to determine which specific
connections are receiving disconnect errors and in what order.

**Hypothesis:** The profile server's error handler is being invoked for both
connections when only one is closed. By adding unique identifiers to each
connection, we can determine if:

1. Both connections genuinely receive errors (XPC library issue)
2. One connection's error handler is being called twice (bug in our code)
3. The connections share some state that gets invalidated (XPC endpoint issue)

**Changes:**

1. **Add connection ID to profile server** (`ts3/termsurf-profile/src/main.rs`)

   Add a static counter and capture it in each connection's error handler:

   ```rust
   // Near other statics at top of file
   static CONNECTION_ID: AtomicU64 = AtomicU64::new(0);
   ```

   In `create_browser_on_ui_thread`, before setting up the event handler:

   ```rust
   let conn_id = crate::CONNECTION_ID.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);
   println!("[CONN-{}] Creating GUI connection for session {}", conn_id, session_id);
   ```

   Update the connection established message:

   ```rust
   let count = crate::GUI_CONNECTION_COUNT.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed) + 1;
   println!("[CONN-{}] GUI connection established (total: {})", conn_id, count);
   ```

   Update the error handler to include the connection ID:

   ```rust
   Err(e) => {
       match e {
           XpcError::ConnectionInterrupted | XpcError::ConnectionInvalid => {
               let count = crate::GUI_CONNECTION_COUNT.fetch_sub(1, Ordering::Relaxed) - 1;
               println!("[CONN-{}] GUI disconnected (remaining: {})", conn_id, count);
               if count == 0 {
                   println!("[CONN-{}] No more GUI connections, exiting gracefully", conn_id);
                   crate::QUIT_FLAG.store(true, Ordering::Relaxed);
               }
           }
           _ => eprintln!("[CONN-{}] GUI connection error: {}", conn_id, e),
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Add logging to GUI connection removal**
   (`ts3/wezterm-gui/src/termwindow/webview_xpc.rs`)

   Update `remove_connection` to log the pointer before removal:

   ```rust
   pub fn remove_connection(&self, pane_id: PaneId) {
       let mut connections = self.peer_connections.lock().unwrap();
       if let Some(conn) = connections.remove(&pane_id) {
           log::info!(
               "[XPC] Removing connection for pane {}: {:p} (dropping Arc)",
               pane_id,
               Arc::as_ptr(&conn)
           );
           // conn is dropped here when it goes out of scope
       } else {
           log::warn!("[XPC] No connection found for pane {}", pane_id);
       }
   }
   ```

**Verification:**

```bash
cd ts3 && ./scripts/build-debug.sh --open

# Test: Open two webviews, close one
web google.com
# Split pane
web google.com
# Close second webview (Ctrl+C twice)

# Check profile server logs
cat /tmp/termsurf-profile-*.log | grep "CONN-"
# Expected output should show:
# [CONN-0] Creating GUI connection for session pane-0-XXXXX
# [CONN-0] GUI connection established (total: 1)
# [CONN-1] Creating GUI connection for session pane-1-XXXXX
# [CONN-1] GUI connection established (total: 2)
# Then when closing pane 1:
# [CONN-1] GUI disconnected (remaining: 1)  <- expected
# [CONN-0] GUI disconnected (remaining: 0)  <- BUG: why is CONN-0 disconnecting?

# Check GUI logs
cat /tmp/termsurf-gui.log | grep "Removing connection"
# Should show only pane 1's connection being removed
```

**Success criteria:**

- [x] Logs clearly show which connection ID receives each disconnect
- [x] Can determine if both connections genuinely error or if it's a double-call
- [x] Identify root cause for further experiments

**Result: Success.** The diagnostic logging revealed the root cause.

**Observed logs:**

Profile server:

```
[CONN-0] Creating GUI connection for session pane-0-29793
[CONN-0] GUI connection established (total: 1)
[CONN-1] Creating GUI connection for session pane-1-29793
[CONN-1] GUI connection established (total: 2)
[CONN-1] GUI disconnected (remaining: 1)
[CONN-1] GUI disconnected (remaining: 0)   <- Same CONN-1, not CONN-0!
[CONN-1] No more GUI connections, exiting gracefully
```

GUI:

```
13:41:33.225  [XPC] Removing connection for pane 1: 0xa82008750 (dropping Arc)
13:41:33.225  ERROR Connection error: XPC connection invalid
13:41:33.293  New connection for session pane-1-29793   <- Mystery reconnection
13:41:33.383  ERROR Connection error: XPC connection invalid
```

**Conclusion:**

The bug is **not** that both CONN-0 and CONN-1 receive errors. Instead,
**CONN-1's error handler fires twice**. Both disconnect messages show
`[CONN-1]`.

The sequence of events:

1. GUI drops `Arc<XpcConnection>` for pane 1
2. XPC invalidates the connection
3. Profile server's CONN-1 error handler fires (count: 2 → 1)
4. Something triggers a reconnection attempt to pane-1's listener
5. GUI accepts this new connection (listener is still alive in
   `Vec<XpcListener>`)
6. This new connection immediately fails
7. CONN-1's error handler fires again (count: 1 → 0)
8. Profile server exits

Two issues identified:

1. **Listeners are never cleaned up** — The GUI stores listeners in a
   `Vec<XpcListener>` that's never pruned. When a webview closes, its listener
   remains active and accepts spurious reconnection attempts.

2. **Double error callback** — The same connection's error handler is invoked
   twice, possibly because XPC sends multiple invalidation events or because the
   reconnection attempt reuses the same handler closure.

**Next step:** Experiment 2 should focus on listener cleanup — removing the
listener when a webview closes to prevent spurious reconnections.

### Experiment 2: Listener Cleanup

**Goal:** Clean up XPC listeners when webviews close to prevent spurious
reconnections.

**Hypothesis:** The mystery reconnection occurs because the listener for pane 1
remains active after the webview closes. By removing the listener when the
webview closes, we can prevent the reconnection and the double error callback.

**Changes:**

1. **Change listener storage from Vec to HashMap**
   (`ts3/wezterm-gui/src/termwindow/webview_xpc.rs`)

   The current structure stores listeners in a Vec with no way to look them up:

   ```rust
   // Current (line 94)
   listeners: Mutex<Vec<XpcListener>>,
   ```

   Change to a HashMap keyed by pane ID:

   ```rust
   // New
   listeners: Mutex<HashMap<PaneId, XpcListener>>,
   ```

2. **Update listener storage in `request_profile_spawn`**

   Current code (line 316):

   ```rust
   self.listeners.lock().unwrap().push(listener);
   ```

   Change to:

   ```rust
   self.listeners.lock().unwrap().insert(pane_id, listener);
   ```

3. **Update initialization in `new()`**

   Current code (line 127):

   ```rust
   listeners: Mutex::new(Vec::new()),
   ```

   Change to:

   ```rust
   listeners: Mutex::new(HashMap::new()),
   ```

4. **Add `remove_listener` method**

   Add a new method to remove the listener when a webview closes:

   ```rust
   /// Remove the XPC listener for a pane (prevents spurious reconnections)
   pub fn remove_listener(&self, pane_id: PaneId) {
       if let Some(_listener) = self.listeners.lock().unwrap().remove(&pane_id) {
           log::info!("[XPC] Removed listener for pane {}", pane_id);
           // listener is dropped here, closing the XPC endpoint
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Call `remove_listener` during webview cleanup**
   (`ts3/wezterm-gui/src/termwindow/keyevent.rs`)

   In `close_webview_for_pane`, add listener removal before connection removal:

   ```rust
   // Before removing connection, remove the listener to prevent reconnections
   xpc_manager.remove_listener(pane_id);
   xpc_manager.remove_connection(pane_id);
   ```

| `ts3/wezterm-gui/src/termwindow/keyevent.rs`    | Call `remove_listener` during close |

**Verification:**

```bash
cd ts3 && ./scripts/build-debug.sh --open

# Test: Open two webviews, close one
web google.com
# Split pane
web google.com
# Close second webview (Ctrl+C twice)

# Check profile server logs
cat /tmp/termsurf-profile-*.log | grep "CONN-"
# Expected:
# [CONN-0] GUI connection established (total: 1)
# [CONN-1] GUI connection established (total: 2)
# [CONN-1] GUI disconnected (remaining: 1)  <- Only ONE disconnect for CONN-1
# NO "[CONN-1] GUI disconnected (remaining: 0)" line

# Check GUI logs
cat /tmp/termsurf-gui.log | grep -E "(Removed listener|Removing connection)"
# Expected:
# [XPC] Removed listener for pane 1
# [XPC] Removing connection for pane 1: 0xABCD (dropping Arc)
# NO "New connection for session pane-1" after removal
```

**Success criteria:**

- [x] Listener is removed before connection during webview close
- [ ] No "New connection" appears after removing pane 1's listener
- [ ] CONN-1's error handler fires only once
- [ ] Profile server remains running with count = 1
- [ ] Pane 0's webview continues to receive frames

**Result: Failure.** Removing the listener made things worse.

**Observed behavior:**

Before experiment 2:

```
[CONN-1] GUI disconnected (remaining: 1)
[CONN-1] GUI disconnected (remaining: 0)   <- Same CONN-1 twice
```

After experiment 2:

```
[CONN-1] GUI disconnected (remaining: 1)
[CONN-0] GUI disconnected (remaining: 0)   <- Now CONN-0 also disconnects!
```

The mystery reconnection still occurred 15ms after removing the listener:

```
13:50:52.548  [XPC] Removed listener for pane 1
13:50:52.563  New connection for session pane-1-32024
```

**Conclusion:**

Dropping the `XpcListener` invalidates more than just the connections created
through that specific listener. It appears to affect the entire XPC subsystem,
causing CONN-0's connection to also fail. This is likely because:

1. The XPC library shares underlying Mach port state between listeners in the
   same process
2. Dropping a listener sends an invalidation that propagates to sibling
   connections
3. There may be reference counting issues in the termsurf-xpc wrapper

The mystery reconnection still occurs because the connection was already
in-flight when we removed the listener.

**Rollback required:** Revert the listener cleanup changes. The correct approach
is not to prevent reconnections, but to make the error handler idempotent so
that multiple disconnect events for the same connection only decrement the count
once.

### Experiment 3: Idempotent Error Handler

**Goal:** Make the profile server's error handler idempotent so that multiple
disconnect events for the same connection only decrement the count once.

**Hypothesis:** The double error callback is unavoidable at the XPC level, but
we can prevent the double decrement by tracking which connections have already
fired their error handler.

**Root cause:** The current design uses a global counter
(`GUI_CONNECTION_COUNT`) that is blindly decremented on every error event. If
XPC fires multiple error events for the same connection (which it does), the
counter decrements multiple times, causing premature exit.

**Solution:** Replace the counter with a `HashSet<u64>` that tracks active
connection IDs. When an error fires, try to remove the connection ID from the
set. Only if the remove succeeds (meaning the connection was still tracked) do
we check if the set is empty.

**Changes:**

1. **Replace counter with HashSet** (`ts3/termsurf-profile/src/main.rs`)

   Remove the atomic counter:

   ```rust
   // Remove this
   static GUI_CONNECTION_COUNT: AtomicUsize = AtomicUsize::new(0);
   ```

   Add a HashSet protected by a Mutex:

   ```rust
   use std::collections::HashSet;
   use std::sync::Mutex;

   // Issue 330, Experiment 3: Track active connections by ID for idempotent cleanup
   static ACTIVE_CONNECTIONS: OnceLock<Mutex<HashSet<u64>>> = OnceLock::new();

   fn active_connections() -> &'static Mutex<HashSet<u64>> {
       ACTIVE_CONNECTIONS.get_or_init(|| Mutex::new(HashSet::new()))
   }
   ```

2. **Update connection establishment** (in `create_browser_on_ui_thread`)

   Replace:

   ```rust
   let count = crate::GUI_CONNECTION_COUNT.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed) + 1;
   println!("[CONN-{}] GUI connection established (total: {})", conn_id, count);
   ```

   With:

   ```rust
   {
       let mut conns = crate::active_connections().lock().unwrap();
       conns.insert(conn_id);
       println!("[CONN-{}] GUI connection established (active: {:?})", conn_id, conns);
   }
   ```

3. **Update error handler** (in the event handler closure)

   Replace:

   ```rust
   Err(e) => {
       match e {
           XpcError::ConnectionInterrupted | XpcError::ConnectionInvalid => {
               let count = crate::GUI_CONNECTION_COUNT.fetch_sub(1, Ordering::Relaxed) - 1;
               println!("[CONN-{}] GUI disconnected (remaining: {})", conn_id_for_handler, count);
               if count == 0 {
                   println!("[CONN-{}] No more GUI connections, exiting gracefully", conn_id_for_handler);
                   crate::QUIT_FLAG.store(true, Ordering::Relaxed);
               }
           }
           _ => eprintln!("[CONN-{}] GUI connection error: {}", conn_id_for_handler, e),
       }
   }
   ```

   With:

   ```rust
   Err(e) => {
       match e {
           XpcError::ConnectionInterrupted | XpcError::ConnectionInvalid => {
               let mut conns = crate::active_connections().lock().unwrap();
               if conns.remove(&conn_id_for_handler) {
                   // This connection was still active, now it's gone
                   println!(
                       "[CONN-{}] GUI disconnected (remaining: {:?})",
                       conn_id_for_handler, conns
                   );
                   if conns.is_empty() {
                       println!(
                           "[CONN-{}] No more GUI connections, exiting gracefully",
                           conn_id_for_handler
                       );
                       drop(conns); // Release lock before setting flag
                       crate::QUIT_FLAG.store(true, std::sync::atomic::Ordering::Relaxed);
                   }
               } else {
                   // Already disconnected - ignore duplicate error
                   println!(
                       "[CONN-{}] Ignoring duplicate disconnect (already removed)",
                       conn_id_for_handler
                   );
               }
           }
           _ => eprintln!("[CONN-{}] GUI connection error: {}", conn_id_for_handler, e),
       }
   }
   ```

# Close second webview (Ctrl+C twice)

# Check profile server logs

# Expected:

# [CONN-1] GUI disconnected (remaining: {0})
# [CONN-1] Ignoring duplicate disconnect (already removed)  <- Idempotent!
# NO exit message - profile server stays running

# Verify pane 0 still works
# Should continue receiving frames
```

**Success criteria:**

- [x] Active connections tracked in HashSet by conn_id
- [x] Duplicate disconnect events are ignored (logged but don't decrement)
- [x] Profile server remains running after closing one webview
- [x] Pane 0's webview continues to receive frames
- [x] Closing pane 0 after pane 1 exits gracefully

**Result: Success.** The idempotent error handler works correctly.

**Observed logs:**

```
[CONN-0] GUI connection established (active: {0})
[CONN-1] GUI connection established (active: {0, 1})
[CONN-1] GUI disconnected (remaining: {0})
[CONN-1] Ignoring duplicate disconnect (already removed)
[CONN-1] Ignoring duplicate disconnect (already removed)
... (many more duplicate events ignored)
[CONN-0] GUI disconnected (remaining: {})
[CONN-0] No more GUI connections, exiting gracefully
```

**Conclusion:**

The HashSet-based tracking makes the error handler idempotent. When CONN-1
closed, XPC fired many duplicate disconnect events, but only the first one
caused a removal from the set. All subsequent events were safely ignored. The
profile server remained running with CONN-0 still active, and pane 0's webview
continued to receive frames. When pane 0 was later closed, the profile server
exited gracefully.

This confirms that the root cause was the non-idempotent counter-based approach,
not any issue with the XPC library itself. The XPC library does fire multiple
error events for a single disconnect, but that's now handled correctly.

### Experiment 4: GUI-Side Cursor Cleanup

**Goal:** Fix memory leak where `webview_cursors` accumulates stale entries after
webviews close.

**Background:** During the issue 330 review, we found that `close_webview_for_pane()`
cleans up most per-pane state but misses `webview_cursors`:

| Map | Cleaned on close? |
|-----|-------------------|
| `peer_connections` | ✅ via `remove_connection()` |
| `received_surfaces` | ✅ via `remove_surface()` |
| `pending_sessions` | ✅ via `remove_surface()` |
| `invalidate_callbacks` | ✅ via `remove_invalidate_callback()` |
| `webview_cursors` | ❌ Never cleaned |
| `listeners` | ❌ Known limitation (experiment 2) |

Each closed webview leaves one stale `i64` in `webview_cursors`. Minor leak but
should be fixed for completeness.

**Changes:**

1. **Update `remove_connection()` to also clean cursors**
   (`ts3/wezterm-gui/src/termwindow/webview_xpc.rs`)

   Current code (line 614-617):

   ```rust
   pub fn remove_connection(&self, pane_id: PaneId) {
       self.peer_connections.lock().unwrap().remove(&pane_id);
       log::info!("[XPC] Removed connection for pane {}", pane_id);
   }
   ```

   Change to:

   ```rust
   pub fn remove_connection(&self, pane_id: PaneId) {
       self.peer_connections.lock().unwrap().remove(&pane_id);
       self.webview_cursors.lock().unwrap().remove(&pane_id);
       log::info!("[XPC] Removed connection for pane {}", pane_id);
   }
   ```

```bash
cd ts3 && ./scripts/build-debug.sh --open

# Test: Open and close webviews repeatedly
web google.com
# Ctrl+C twice to close
web google.com
# Ctrl+C twice to close
# Repeat several times

# Check logs for cleanup messages
cat /tmp/termsurf-gui.log | grep "Removed connection"
# Should see cleanup happening each time
```

**Success criteria:**

- [x] `webview_cursors` cleaned when webview closes
- [x] No functional regression (cursor still works while webview is open)
- [x] Cleanup logged for debugging

**Result: Success.** One-line fix works as expected.

### Experiment 5: Fix Block Leak in termsurf-xpc

**Goal:** Stop leaking Objective-C blocks when setting XPC event handlers.

**Background:** Research revealed that `xpc_connection_set_event_handler` copies the
block via `Block_copy()` internally. The current code unnecessarily leaks blocks:

```rust
// Current code (block.rs:46-52)
let block = RcBlock::new(move |event| { ... });
let block_ptr = RcBlock::into_raw(block);  // LEAK: +1 ref never released
xpc_connection_set_event_handler(conn.as_raw(), block_ptr as *mut _);
```

This creates two references:
1. Our leaked reference (via `into_raw`)
2. XPC's copy (via `Block_copy`)

When the connection is canceled, XPC releases its copy, but our leaked copy persists.

**Research findings:**

| Finding | Source |
|---------|--------|
| XPC copies blocks via `Block_copy` | [libxpc source](https://github.com/jceel/libxpc/blob/master/xpc_connection.c) |
| `xpc_connection_cancel` releases handler blocks | [xpc_object man page](https://keith.github.io/xcode-man-pages/xpc_hash.3.html) |
| RcBlock is ref-counted; safe to drop after passing to copying API | [block2 docs](https://docs.rs/block2/latest/block2/) |

**Fix:** Pass a reference to the block, then let it drop normally. XPC has its own copy.

**Changes:**

1. **Update `set_event_handler`** (`ts3/termsurf-xpc/src/block.rs`)

   Current code (lines 39-53):

   ```rust
   let handler = Arc::new(handler);

   let block = RcBlock::new(move |event: ffi::xpc_object_t| {
       let result = unsafe { XpcConnection::parse_event(event) };
       handler(result);
   });

   // Leak the block to ensure it lives forever.
   // This is necessary because XPC holds a reference to the block
   // and we have no way to know when XPC is done with it.
   let block_ptr = RcBlock::into_raw(block);

   unsafe {
       ffi::xpc_connection_set_event_handler(conn.as_raw(), block_ptr as *mut _);
   }
   ```

   Change to:

   ```rust
   let handler = Arc::new(handler);

   let block = RcBlock::new(move |event: ffi::xpc_object_t| {
       let result = unsafe { XpcConnection::parse_event(event) };
       handler(result);
   });

   // XPC copies the block via Block_copy(), so we can let ours drop.
   // When the connection is canceled, XPC releases its copy.
   unsafe {
       ffi::xpc_connection_set_event_handler(
           conn.as_raw(),
           &*block as *const _ as *mut std::ffi::c_void,
       );
   }
   // block drops here, decrementing ref count (XPC still has its copy)
   ```

2. **Update `set_new_connection_handler`** (same file, lines 101-125)

   Same pattern: remove `into_raw()`, pass `&*block as *const _ as *mut _`.

3. **Update doc comments** to remove outdated "leak" warnings.

**Files to modify:**

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `ts3/termsurf-xpc/src/block.rs` | Remove `into_raw()` leaks, pass block references |

**Verification:**

```bash
cd ts3 && cargo build

# Run with memory profiler to verify no leak
# (Manual verification - open/close many webviews, check memory growth)
./scripts/build-debug.sh --open

# Open and close 20+ webviews
for i in {1..20}; do
  web google.com
  # Ctrl+C twice to close
done

# Memory should stabilize, not grow unbounded
```

**Success criteria:**

- [x] Blocks not leaked (no `into_raw()` calls)
- [x] XPC event handling still works (messages received)
- [x] Webview open/close still works
- [x] No crashes or memory corruption

**Result: Success.** XPC copies blocks via `Block_copy()` as documented. Events
(focus, key_event, frames) continue to be delivered correctly. No regressions.

## Success Criteria

- [x] Closing one webview does not affect other webviews
- [x] Profile server remains running while at least one webview is active
- [x] Connection tracking accurately reflects active connections
- [x] Duplicate disconnect events are handled gracefully (idempotent)
