# Issue 625: CALayerHost

## Goal

Replace the `FrameSinkVideoCapturer` with `CALayerHost` so that browser panes
display with the same latency as native Chrome — zero per-frame IPC, zero
application-side compositing, Window Server composites directly from GPU VRAM.

## Chromium Branch

`146.0.7650.0-issue-625` (forked from `146.0.7650.0-issue-616`)

## Background

### The current pipeline

TermSurf runs Chromium out-of-process. A Chromium Profile Server renders web
content and streams frames to the GUI (a Ghostty fork) over XPC. The current
frame delivery path:

```
Chromium renders → compositor composites → FrameSinkVideoCapturer (timer) →
CopyOutputRequest → IOSurface → Mach port via XPC → GUI imports IOSurface →
Metal shader composites → CVDisplayLink vsync → screen
```

This adds 15–25ms of latency versus native Chrome
([Issue 619](619-input-latency.md)). The single biggest contributor is the
`FrameSinkVideoCapturer` — a recording API that runs on its own timer, adding
~5-7ms per frame from timer wait and GPU readback. On top of that, every frame
requires a Mach port transfer over XPC.

### What we learned in Issue 624

[Issue 624](624-chromium-ipc.md) mapped Chromium's full IPC architecture across
three experiments:

1. **Chrome's normal display path uses `CALayerHost`.** The GPU process creates
   a `CAContext`, sends a `ca_context_id` (uint32) once, and the browser process
   creates a `CALayerHost` pointing to that ID. Window Server composites the GPU
   process's CALayer tree directly from VRAM. Zero per-frame IPC, zero pixel
   copies.

2. **Our Chromium Profile Server already produces `CALayerParams` every frame.**
   The capturer is purely observational — the normal display path runs alongside
   it. We've been ignoring `CALayerParams` output at
   `RenderWidgetHostViewMac::AcceleratedWidgetCALayerParamsUpdated()`.

3. **Electron validates this approach.** Electron's normal `BrowserWindow` uses
   stock Chromium — CALayerHost, unmodified, zero custom display code.
   Electron's off-screen rendering mode uses the same `FrameSinkVideoCapturer`
   that TermSurf currently uses, with the same latency penalty. CALayerHost is
   the architecturally correct way to display Chromium content.

### Why CALayerHost

The `ca_context_id` is a uint32 that identifies a `CAContext` in the GPU
process. `CALayerHost` is a `CALayer` subclass that displays a remote
`CAContext` from another process — Window Server handles the compositing. This
is the same mechanism Chrome uses between its own GPU process and browser
process. Adding one more process boundary (Chromium server → TermSurf GUI) is
the same pattern.

**What it eliminates:**

- `FrameSinkVideoCapturer` and `ShellVideoConsumer` (~460 lines)
- Per-frame `CopyOutputRequest` GPU readback
- Per-frame IOSurface Mach port transfer over XPC
- Per-frame Metal texture import and shader compositing in the GUI
- The ~5-7ms capturer timer latency

**What it adds:**

- One XPC message per tab containing a uint32 `ca_context_id` (sent once, not
  per frame)
- A `CALayerHost` sublayer in the GUI, positioned at browser pane coordinates
- Dimming of inactive browser panes via a sibling `CALayer` with
  semi-transparent background

**Architectural change:** Browser pane content moves out of the Metal shader
pipeline. Terminal panes render via Metal (unchanged). Browser panes render via
`CALayerHost` — Window Server composites them. Both coexist as sibling
`CALayer`s in the same NSView layer tree. The GUI still controls positioning and
z-order, but does not touch browser pixels.

### What needs to change

Two sides:

**Chromium Profile Server** (in `chromium/src/`):

- Intercept `CALayerParams` at
  `RenderWidgetHostViewMac::AcceleratedWidgetCALayerParamsUpdated()`
- Extract `ca_context_id` from the params
- Send it over XPC to the GUI (once per tab, re-send on context change)
- Remove `ShellVideoConsumer` and all capturer setup

**TermSurf GUI** (in `gui/`):

- Receive `ca_context_id` over XPC
- Create `CALayerHost` with that `contextId`
- Add as sublayer of the window's content view, positioned at the browser pane's
  pixel coordinates
- Update position/size on pane resize and split changes
- Add dimming overlay `CALayer` for inactive browser panes
- Remove the IOSurface overlay pipeline from the Metal renderer (the pink
  texture proof-of-concept from [Issue 602](602-pink-texture.md), the IOSurface
  import from [Issue 603](603-box-demo.md))

### Open questions

Before implementing, we need to research the TermSurf codebase to understand:

1. **Where does the GUI currently receive IOSurface frames?** Trace the XPC
   message path from reception to Metal rendering. What code handles the Mach
   port, imports the IOSurface, and passes it to the renderer?

2. **How does the Metal renderer currently composite browser content?** What
   shaders, pipeline state, and draw calls are involved? What gets deleted?

3. **Where in the Zig/Swift layer hierarchy should `CALayerHost` live?** The GUI
   uses a `CAMetalLayer` for terminal rendering. `CALayerHost` needs to be a
   sibling or sublayer. What's the current NSView/CALayer structure?

4. **How does pane positioning work?** When a split pane resizes, how do pixel
   coordinates propagate? The `CALayerHost` needs to track these coordinates.

5. **Can `CALayerHost` be created from Zig?** Zig already calls Objective-C
   runtime APIs for Metal. `CALayerHost` is another `CALayer` subclass — same
   pattern. But we need to verify the specific API calls.

## Experiments

### Experiment 1: Map the current pipeline

A source code research experiment — no code changes, no builds. Read the
TermSurf GUI and Chromium Profile Server source to trace the complete frame
delivery pipeline from end to end. The goal is to know exactly what code to
change before writing a single line.

#### Q1: XPC frame reception in the GUI

Trace the path from XPC message arrival to Metal rendering. Where does the GUI
receive IOSurface Mach ports, and how do they reach the renderer?

**Where to look:**

- `gui/src/apprt/embedded.zig` — C API exports. Search for XPC-related functions
  and `overlay` / `iosurface` / `mach_port` references.
- `gui/src/Surface.zig` — the core surface. Search for overlay state, IOSurface
  fields, and any XPC callback handling.
- `gui/src/renderer/Metal.zig` — the Metal renderer. Search for IOSurface
  import, overlay texture, and how the browser frame gets composited.
- `gui/macos/` — Swift code. Search for XPC message handling, Mach port
  extraction, and calls into the Zig C API.

**Deliverable:** A sequence diagram from XPC message arrival to Metal draw call,
with every function, file, and line number labeled. Identify exactly what gets
deleted.

#### Q2: Metal overlay pipeline

Map the Metal shader pipeline that composites browser content. What render pass,
pipeline state, vertex buffer, and fragment shader are involved?

**Where to look:**

- `gui/src/renderer/Metal.zig` — search for `overlay`, `iosurface`, `browser`,
  or any render pass that handles non-terminal content.
- `gui/src/renderer/metal/` — shader files, pipeline definitions. What shaders
  draw the browser overlay?
- Search for `IOSurface` across all of `gui/src/` — every reference needs to be
  cataloged for removal.

**Deliverable:** A list of every Metal resource (pipeline state, shader
function, vertex buffer, texture, render pass) used for the browser overlay.
Each item should be annotated with: keep, delete, or modify.

#### Q3: NSView and CALayer hierarchy

Map the current layer tree. Where does `CAMetalLayer` live? What is the NSView
structure? Where should `CALayerHost` be inserted?

**Where to look:**

- `gui/macos/Sources/` — Swift app code. Search for `NSView`, `CALayer`,
  `CAMetalLayer`, `contentView`, `wantsLayer`, `makeBackingLayer`.
- `gui/src/apprt/embedded.zig` — how the Zig side references the view/layer.
- Look at how Ghostty's Metal renderer gets its `CAMetalLayer` — this is the
  layer that `CALayerHost` needs to sit on top of.

**Deliverable:** A layer tree diagram showing the current NSView/CALayer
hierarchy, with the proposed insertion point for `CALayerHost` marked.

#### Q4: Pane coordinate propagation

Understand how the GUI tracks browser pane pixel coordinates. The `CALayerHost`
frame (position + size) must update when panes resize.

**Where to look:**

- `gui/src/Surface.zig` — how does the surface know its pixel bounds within the
  window? Search for `screen`, `padding`, `grid`, `size`, `viewport`.
- `gui/src/apprt/embedded.zig` — how do resize events propagate?
- The current overlay pipeline — how does it know where to position the browser
  content? Whatever coordinate system it uses is what `CALayerHost` needs.

**Deliverable:** The exact fields and functions that provide browser pane pixel
coordinates (origin x, origin y, width, height) relative to the window.

#### Q5: Chromium server side — CALayerParams interception

Map the Chromium Profile Server's current frame sending code and identify where
to intercept `CALayerParams` instead.

**Where to look:**

- `chromium/src/content/shell/browser/shell_video_consumer.cc` and `.h` — the
  current capturer. Trace how it sends IOSurface Mach ports over XPC.
- `chromium/src/content/shell/browser/shell_browser_main_parts.cc` — where the
  capturer is created and connected to XPC. This is where `CALayerParams`
  interception would go instead.
- `chromium/src/content/browser/renderer_host/render_widget_host_view_mac.mm` —
  `AcceleratedWidgetCALayerParamsUpdated()` at line 156. How to hook into this
  callback for our Content Shell.

**Deliverable:** A before/after outline showing: (1) what currently sends frames
over XPC, (2) what replaces it (CALayerParams interception), and (3) what gets
deleted.

#### Verification

Research is complete when we can draw the full before/after picture:

1. **Before:** Complete trace from Chromium capturer → XPC → GUI → Metal draw
   call, with every file and function labeled.
2. **After:** Complete trace from Chromium `CALayerParams` callback → XPC
   (ca_context_id once) → GUI → `CALayerHost` sublayer, with proposed code
   changes for each step.
3. A definitive layer tree diagram showing where `CALayerHost` sits relative to
   `CAMetalLayer`.
4. The coordinate system for positioning `CALayerHost` at browser pane bounds.

#### Results

##### A1: XPC frame reception — the current pipeline

The entire pipeline is Zig — no Swift intermediary. XPC messages arrive on a
serial GCD queue, IOSurface references are stored on the renderer struct behind
a mutex, and `drawFrame` creates a transient Metal texture from the IOSurface
each frame.

```
Chromium Profile Server
  │ XPC: { action: "display_surface", iosurface_port: <mach_port>, pane_id }
  ▼

       │    (zero-copy MTLTexture from IOSurface GPU memory)
       ├─ Buffer(PinkOverlay).initFill(overlay_params)
       └─ pass.step(pipeline=overlay, textures={tex}, vertex_count=4)
            │

shaders.metal:overlay_fragment()                         line 912-918
  sample IOSurface texture → BGRA color
```

The overlay position is set separately via `set_overlay` XPC message →
`xpc.zig:handleSetOverlay()` (line 267) → `Surface.zig:setOverlay()` (line
2499), which stores grid coordinates in the `PinkOverlay` struct.

##### A2: Metal overlay pipeline — what gets deleted

Every Metal resource for the browser overlay is cleanly isolated from terminal
rendering. Nothing shared needs modification.

**DELETE — browser overlay only:**

| Resource                                        | File                | Lines            |

| `ghostty_surface_is_overlay_forwarding`         | `embedded.zig`      | 1749-1752        |

**KEEP — terminal rendering (unaffected):**

- Pipelines: `bg_color`, `cell_bg`, `cell_text`, `image`, `bg_image`
- `Uniforms` struct (read-only by overlay shaders, unchanged by removal)
- `IOSurfaceLayer` — the terminal's presentation layer, NOT the browser overlay
- `Overlay.zig` — Ghostty's inspector debug overlay (unrelated to browser)

##### A3: NSView/CALayer hierarchy and CALayerHost insertion point

The current layer tree:

```
NSWindow (TerminalWindow)
  └─ contentView → TerminalViewContainer (NSView)
       └─ NSHostingView (hosts SwiftUI)
            └─ TerminalSplitTreeView → SplitView(s)
                 └─ [per split pane]
                      └─ SurfaceRepresentable (NSViewRepresentable)
                           └─ SurfaceScrollView (NSView)
                                └─ NSScrollView → NSClipView → documentView
                                     └─ SurfaceView (NSView, layer-hosting)
                                          └─ layer: IOSurfaceLayer (CALayer subclass)
                                               contents = terminal IOSurface
                                               (no sublayers)
```

**Critical detail:** SurfaceView is a **layer-hosting view** — Zig sets `layer`
BEFORE `wantsLayer = true` (`Metal.zig:124-125`), giving the application full
control over the layer tree. AppKit does not create a default backing layer.

**Proposed insertion — CALayerHost as sublayer of IOSurfaceLayer:**

```
SurfaceView (layer-hosting)
  └─ layer: IOSurfaceLayer (terminal content)
       ├─ sublayer: CALayerHost (browser content)    ← NEW
       │    contextId = Chromium's ca_context_id
       │    frame = overlay pixel rect
       └─ sublayer: CALayer (dimming overlay)         ← NEW (inactive panes)
            backgroundColor = (0, 0, 0, 0.4)
            frame = same as CALayerHost
```

This works because:

- Layer-hosting means we control the layer tree from Zig
- `CALayerHost` as a sublayer composites ON TOP of terminal content
- Window Server handles compositing — no Metal draw calls for browser content
- The dimming layer sits above the CALayerHost for inactive pane dimming

Key files for the insertion point:

| What                    | File                       | Line    |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ------- |
| IOSurfaceLayer creation | `Metal.zig`                | 111     |
| Layer-hosting setup     | `Metal.zig`                | 124-125 |
| IOSurfaceLayer subclass | `metal/IOSurfaceLayer.zig` | 138-183 |
| SurfaceView class       | `SurfaceView_AppKit.swift` | 10      |
| NSView pointer to Zig   | `SurfaceView.swift`        | 694-695 |

##### A4: Pane coordinate system

The overlay uses **grid coordinates** (column/row in terminal cells) as source
of truth, converted to pixels at render time via `cell_size`.

**Current conversion (shader-side):**

```
origin_px = (grid_col, grid_row) * cell_size
size_px = (pixel_width, pixel_height)  // from IOSurface dimensions
```

**For CALayerHost, the same conversion applies but in Zig:**

```zig
const x = pink_overlay.grid_col * cell_width;
const y = pink_overlay.grid_row * cell_height;
const w = pixel_width;  // from Chromium's reported size
const h = pixel_height;
ca_layer_host.setFrame(.{ .origin = .{ x, y }, .size = .{ w, h } });
```

**Critical finding: each surface has its own coordinate space starting at (0,
0).** The `SurfaceView` has no knowledge of its position within the window.
Overlay grid coordinates are relative to the surface's own grid. Since
`CALayerHost` will be a sublayer of IOSurfaceLayer (which IS the surface's root
layer), its frame is also relative to the surface — no window-relative
coordinates needed.

**Resize propagation:**

1. SwiftUI detects size change → `sizeDidChange()` →
   `ghostty_surface_set_size()` → renderer updates uniforms
2. `web` TUI detects terminal resize → sends new `set_overlay` with updated grid
   coordinates → XPC handler recomputes pixel dimensions → sends `resize` to
   Chromium
3. CALayerHost frame updates when new grid coordinates arrive (same path as
   current overlay)

**Key fields:**

| What                   | How                                      | Location           |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Grid coordinates       | `pink_overlay.grid_col/row/width/height` | `generic.zig:151`  |
| Cell size (pixels)     | `grid_metrics.cell_width/height`         | `generic.zig:110`  |
| Surface size (pixels)  | `self.size.screen.width/height`          | `Surface.zig:150`  |
| Content scale (Retina) | `rt_surface.getContentScale()`           | `Surface.zig:2474` |

##### A5: Chromium server side — before and after

**BEFORE — capturer path:**

`ShellVideoConsumer` (`shell_video_consumer.cc/h`) creates a
`ClientFrameSinkVideoCapturer` at 120fps. On every captured frame:

```
OnFrameCaptured()                                        line 258-332
  ├─ Extract IOSurfaceRef from gpu_memory_buffer_handle  line 270
  ├─ IOSurfaceCreateMachPort(io_surface)                 line 277
  ├─ Build XPC dict: { action: "display_surface",
  │    iosurface_port: <mach_port>, pane_id }
  ├─ xpc_connection_send_message(tab_connection, msg)    line 285
  └─ mach_port_deallocate(port)                          line 287
```

Created in `shell_browser_main_parts.cc:CreateTab()` (line 354-405): creates
consumer, sets pane ID and size, opens per-tab XPC connection, sends
`tab_ready`, hands connection to consumer.

**AFTER — CALayerParams interception:**

Replace the capturer with a callback on
`AcceleratedWidgetCALayerParamsUpdated()`. Two options:

- **Option A:** Add a callback on `RenderWidgetHostViewMac` (similar to existing
  `SetCursorChangedCallback` pattern at line 394) that fires with
  `ca_context_id` when `AcceleratedWidgetCALayerParamsUpdated()` is called.
- **Option B:** After `RenderViewReady()`, query
  `browser_compositor_->GetLastCALayerParams()->ca_context_id` and send it once.

New XPC message format:

```
Sent once per tab (and on ca_context_id change):
{
  "action": "ca_context",
  "ca_context_id": <uint32>,
  "pane_id": "<uuid>",
  "pixel_width": <uint64>,
  "pixel_height": <uint64>,
  "scale_factor": "<string>"    // XPC has no float type
}
```

**PRESERVE (move out of ShellVideoConsumer):**

The video consumer currently doubles as a `WebContentsObserver` for navigation
and loading state. These notifications must move to a simpler observer:

- `DidFinishNavigation` → URL change notifications (lines 90-144)
- `DidStartLoading`/`DidStopLoading`/`LoadProgressChanged` (lines 161-193)
- Cursor change callback (via `SetCursorChangedCallback`, line 394)

#### Conclusion

The full before/after picture is clear:

**Before:** Chromium capturer (120fps timer) → IOSurface → Mach port → XPC (per
frame) → Zig imports IOSurface → Metal texture → shader composites → screen.
~460 lines of capturer code, per-frame GPU readback, per-frame Mach port
transfer.

**After:** Chromium `AcceleratedWidgetCALayerParamsUpdated()` → extract
`ca_context_id` (uint32) → XPC (once) → Zig creates `CALayerHost` as sublayer of
IOSurfaceLayer → Window Server composites from GPU VRAM → screen. ~50 lines of
interception code, zero per-frame IPC.

The layer hierarchy is clean: `IOSurfaceLayer` (terminal) with `CALayerHost`
(browser) as sublayer. Each surface has its own coordinate space starting at (0,
0), so CALayerHost frame coordinates match the current grid-to-pixel conversion.
No window-relative math needed.

The Chromium side needs: delete `ShellVideoConsumer`, add a `CALayerParams`
callback, move `WebContentsObserver` notifications to a simpler class. The GUI
side needs: delete the entire Metal overlay pipeline, add `CALayerHost` creation
and positioning in Zig via Objective-C runtime calls.

### Experiment 2: Implement CALayerHost

Replace the `FrameSinkVideoCapturer` pipeline with `CALayerHost`. Two sides:
Chromium Profile Server sends `ca_context_id` instead of IOSurface Mach ports,
GUI creates a `CALayerHost` sublayer instead of Metal-compositing an IOSurface
texture.

#### Step 1: Chromium — intercept CALayerParams and send ca_context_id

**In `shell_browser_main_parts.cc`:**

1. Add a `CALayerParams` callback on `RenderWidgetHostViewMac`. Follow the
   existing `SetCursorChangedCallback` pattern (line 394). When
   `AcceleratedWidgetCALayerParamsUpdated()` fires, extract `ca_context_id` from
   `GetLastCALayerParams()`. If it differs from the last sent value, send an XPC
   message:

   ```
   { "action": "ca_context", "ca_context_id": <uint32>, "pane_id": "<uuid>" }
   ```

2. In `CreateTab()`, replace the `ShellVideoConsumer` creation (lines 354-405)
   with the new callback registration. Keep the per-tab XPC connection and
   `tab_ready` message — those are still needed.

3. Remove the `resize` XPC handler (lines 219-227) and `ResizeCapture()` (lines
   411-446). Resize is handled automatically — the compositor produces new
   `CALayerParams` at the new size, and the GUI updates the `CALayerHost` frame
   when `set_overlay` arrives with new grid coordinates.

**Move `WebContentsObserver` notifications out of `ShellVideoConsumer`:**

4. Create a lightweight `ShellTabObserver` class (or add observer methods
   directly to `ShellBrowserMainParts`) that observes the `WebContents` for:
   - `DidFinishNavigation` → send `url_changed` over XPC
   - `DidStartLoading` / `DidStopLoading` / `LoadProgressChanged` → send
     `loading_state` over XPC
   - `DidFailLoad` → send `loading_state` with error

   The cursor change callback (`SetCursorChangedCallback`) stays on
   `RenderWidgetHostImpl` — it's independent of the video consumer.

**Delete `ShellVideoConsumer`:**

5. Delete `shell_video_consumer.cc` (347 lines) and `shell_video_consumer.h`
   (113 lines). Remove their entries from `BUILD.gn` (lines 201-202). Remove the
   `#include` and forward declaration from `shell_browser_main_parts`.

#### Step 2: GUI — receive ca_context_id and create CALayerHost

**In `xpc.zig`:**

6. Add a `handleCAContext()` handler for the `"ca_context"` action. Extract
   `ca_context_id` (uint32) from the XPC message. Look up the pane by `pane_id`.
   Call a new method on the surface to set the CALayerHost.

**In `Surface.zig`:**

7. Add `setCAContextId(context_id: u32)` method. This replaces
   `setOverlayIOSurface()`. Behind `draw_mutex`:
   - Store the `context_id` on the renderer
   - Call into the renderer to create/update the `CALayerHost`

**In `Metal.zig` or a new `CALayerHost.zig`:**

8. Create the `CALayerHost` via Objective-C runtime calls:
   ```
   objc_getClass("CALayerHost")
   objc_msgSend(class, "alloc")
   objc_msgSend(instance, "init")
   objc_msgSend(instance, "setContextId:", context_id)
   ```
   Add it as a sublayer of the IOSurfaceLayer:
   ```
   objc_msgSend(iosurface_layer, "addSublayer:", ca_layer_host)
   ```

9. Set the `CALayerHost` frame to the browser pane pixel coordinates:
   ```
   frame.origin.x = grid_col * cell_width
   frame.origin.y = grid_row * cell_height
   frame.size.width = pixel_width
   frame.size.height = pixel_height
   ```
   This frame updates whenever `set_overlay` arrives with new grid coordinates.

#### Step 3: GUI — delete the Metal overlay pipeline

10. Delete from `shaders.metal`: `PinkOverlayIn` struct, `OverlayVertexOut`
    struct, `pink_overlay_vertex`, `pink_overlay_fragment`, `overlay_vertex`,
    `overlay_fragment`.

11. Delete from `metal/shaders.zig`: `pink_overlay` and `overlay` pipeline
    definitions, `PinkOverlay` struct.

12. Delete from `metal/Texture.zig`: `fromIOSurface()` and IOSurface extern
    declarations.

13. Delete from `generic.zig`: the IOSurface overlay draw call block (lines
    1661-1688), fields `pink_overlay`, `overlay_iosurface`,
    `overlay_surface_changed`.

14. Delete from `Surface.zig`: `setOverlay()`, `setOverlayIOSurface()`,
    `clearOverlay()`, `hitTestOverlay()`, `mapChromiumCursor()`,
    `overlay_cursor_type` field.

15. Delete from `xpc.zig`: `handleDisplaySurface()`, IOSurface externs.

16. Delete from `embedded.zig`: `ghostty_surface_is_overlay_forwarding`.

#### Step 4: GUI — update overlay positioning for CALayerHost

17. Modify `handleSetOverlay()` in `xpc.zig` to update the `CALayerHost` frame
    instead of storing `PinkOverlay` grid coordinates on the renderer. The
    conversion is the same (grid × cell_size = pixels), but the target is
    `CALayerHost.frame` instead of a shader uniform buffer.

18. Update `hitTestOverlay()` replacement — hit testing against the
    `CALayerHost` frame rect instead of the `PinkOverlay` grid coordinates. The
    logic is the same, just reading from the layer frame.

19. Update `clearOverlay()` replacement — remove the `CALayerHost` sublayer when
    the browser pane closes.

#### Verification

1. Build Chromium Profile Server
   (`autoninja -C out/Default
   chromium_profile_server`).
2. Build TermSurf GUI (`cd gui && zig build`).
3. Launch the app, open a terminal, type `web google.com`.
4. **Pass criteria:**
   - Web page renders in the browser pane at the correct position
   - No visible lag increase compared to the capturer path (should be noticeably
     better)
   - Text selection tracks the cursor without visible delay
   - Scrolling feels responsive
   - Pane resize works — browser content resizes with the pane
   - Multiple panes with different profiles work
   - Closing a browser pane cleans up the CALayerHost
5. **Bonus verification:**
   - Compare text selection latency side-by-side with native Chrome
   - Verify no per-frame XPC messages in Console.app / log stream

**Result:** Fail

Both builds succeed — Chromium Profile Server and TermSurf GUI compile without
errors. The app launches, a terminal opens, and `web news.ycombinator.com` loads
the page. The CALayerHost receives the `ca_context_id` and the web content is
visible. So the core pipeline works: Chromium → XPC (ca_context_id once) →
CALayerHost → Window Server compositing.

However, the CALayerHost is positioned catastrophically wrong. Instead of
appearing at the overlay viewport position (near the top of the surface), the
web content is pushed to the bottom of the screen with only the top ~10%
visible. The error is so severe that no other functionality could be tested.

**Root cause:** CALayer on macOS uses Y=0 at the **bottom** (Y increases
upward), but the terminal grid has row 0 at the **top** (Y increases downward).
`updateCALayerHostFrame()` in `Metal.zig` naively sets
`frame.origin.y = grid_row * cell_height`, which places a small grid row (like
row 1–2) at a small Y value — near the bottom in CALayer coordinates. The fix is
to flip Y: `flipped_y = parent_layer_height - y - h`.

#### Conclusion

The architecture is sound — CALayerHost works for displaying Chromium content
from another process, the XPC one-shot `ca_context_id` delivery works, and
Window Server composites the content. The implementation has a coordinate system
bug that prevents testing any other functionality. Experiment 3 should fix the Y
coordinate flip and re-verify.

### Experiment 3: Fix CALayerHost Y coordinate

Fix the Y-axis inversion bug from Experiment 2 and re-verify the full
CALayerHost pipeline.

#### Problem

CALayer on macOS uses a bottom-left origin (Y=0 at the bottom, Y increases
upward). The terminal grid uses a top-left origin (row 0 at the top, row
increases downward). `updateCALayerHostFrame()` in `Metal.zig` sets
`frame.origin.y = grid_row * cell_height` without flipping, placing the
CALayerHost near the bottom of the parent layer instead of near the top.

#### Fix

Two options:

- **Option A — flip Y manually.** Read the parent layer's bounds height and
  compute `flipped_y = parent_height - y - h`. Requires passing the surface
  height into `updateCALayerHostFrame()`.

- **Option B — set `geometryFlipped = true` on the IOSurfaceLayer.** This tells
  Core Animation that sublayers use a top-left coordinate system (Y=0 at top, Y
  increases downward). Only affects sublayer geometry, not the layer's own
  `contents` rendering. No Y math needed —
  `frame.origin.y = grid_row *
  cell_height` works as-is.

Option B is cleaner (one property, no math), but it could have side effects on
terminal rendering if any other code assumes the default bottom-left geometry.
Since no existing code adds sublayers to the IOSurfaceLayer (CALayerHost is the
first), Option B should be safe. However, Option A is more conservative and
explicit.

#### Changes

**In `Metal.zig` — `updateCALayerHostFrame()`:**

1. Add the surface screen height as a parameter (from `self.size.screen.height`
   on the GenericRenderer).
2. Flip Y: `flipped_y = parent_height - y - h`.
3. Remove the incorrect comment claiming the coordinate system is already
   top-left.

**In `generic.zig` — `updateCALayerHostFrame()`:**

4. Pass `self.size.screen.height` to the Metal call.

#### Verification

Same as Experiment 2:

1. Build TermSurf GUI (`cd gui && zig build`).
2. Launch the app, open a terminal, type `web news.ycombinator.com`.
3. **Pass criteria:**
   - Web page renders at the correct position (aligned with the TUI viewport)
   - Scrolling feels responsive
   - Text selection tracks the cursor
   - Pane resize works — browser content resizes with the pane
   - Multiple panes with different profiles work
   - Closing a browser pane cleans up the CALayerHost
4. **Bonus verification:**
   - Compare text selection latency side-by-side with native Chrome
   - Verify no per-frame XPC messages in Console.app / log stream
