# Issue 403: Swift + Rust + C++ Architecture Prototype

## Goal

Build the simplest possible application that proves the TermSurf 4.0
multi-process, multi-language architecture works. No terminal emulation. No
browser. Just three processes, three languages, and two colored rectangles
composited into one window at 60fps.

## Product Requirements

1. A macOS window opens showing two panes side by side.
2. The left pane is **blue**, rendered by a **Rust** process.
3. The right pane is **green**, rendered by a **C++** process.
4. The window itself is a **Swift** application.
5. Each colored rectangle is a GPU texture (IOSurface) created by its respective
   process and shared with the Swift window via XPC Mach port transfer.
6. The window composites both textures into a single frame at 60fps.
7. Resizing the window resizes both panes proportionally.

## Rationale

### Why this prototype matters

TermSurf 4.0's architecture (Issue 400) requires three languages working
together across process boundaries:

- **Swift** for the window (native macOS, Metal, XPC)
- **Rust** for the terminal (WezTerm crates, wgpu)
- **C++** for the browser (Chromium Content API)

Before building any real functionality, we must prove that:

1. A Swift window can receive and composite GPU textures from foreign processes.
2. A Rust process can render to an IOSurface and send it via XPC.
3. A C++ process can render to an IOSurface and send it via XPC.
4. The compositing runs at 60fps with no visible artifacts.
5. The three build systems (Xcode/SwiftPM, Cargo, CMake/Make) can coexist.

If any of these fail, we discover it now — not after building a terminal or
embedding Chromium.

### Why Swift for the window

Issue 401 (programming-language.md) recommended Rust for the window with
terminal in-process. Issue 402 (wezterm-vs-alacritty.md) moved the terminal
out-of-process, making the window a pure compositor. With no terminal library
embedded, the window process has no Rust dependency. This reopens the language
choice.

Swift wins for the window because:

1. **XPC is native.** `xpc_connection_create`, `xpc_dictionary_set_mach_send`,
   `xpc_connection_send_message` — all C API, callable from Swift with zero
   bridging. No `block2` crate, no unsafe FFI.

2. **Metal is native.** `MTLDevice`, `MTLTexture`, `IOSurface` — Swift has
   first-class access. Creating a Metal texture from an IOSurface is a
   one-liner: `device.makeTexture(descriptor:iosurface:plane:)`.

3. **AppKit is native.** `NSWindow`, `NSView`, `CAMetalLayer` — no winit
   abstraction layer, no platform quirks. Window management, fullscreen, split
   view, menu bar, notifications — all free.

4. **The window is simple.** It's a compositor and input router. It doesn't
   parse VTE sequences, shape fonts, or run a JavaScript engine. The complexity
   lives in the terminal and browser processes. The window is glue — and Swift
   is excellent glue for macOS.

5. **macOS-first is accepted.** Issue 401 established that macOS-first is fine.
   If we port to Linux/Windows later, only the window process needs rewriting
   (to Rust + winit + wgpu or similar). The terminal and browser processes are
   unchanged.

### Why not Rust for the window

With the terminal out-of-process (Issue 402), the window doesn't embed any Rust
library. The only Rust code it would use is `termsurf-xpc` — XPC bindings that
wrap the same C API Swift calls natively. Using Rust for the window means:

- winit for window management (adequate but not native)
- wgpu for compositing (works but adds a layer over Metal)
- `termsurf-xpc` for XPC (1,417 lines wrapping what Swift does in 0 lines)
- Objective-C FFI via `block2` and `objc` crates for any macOS-native feature

All of this is overhead to avoid writing Swift. With the terminal
out-of-process, that overhead buys nothing.

```

### Process Lifecycle

1. Swift window launches and creates two XPC anonymous listeners.
2. Swift spawns the Rust process, passing the first listener's endpoint as a
   launch argument (serialized via `xpc_endpoint_create` or Mach bootstrap).
3. Swift spawns the C++ process, passing the second listener's endpoint.
4. Each child connects to its assigned listener, establishing a direct XPC
   channel.
5. Each child renders its color to an IOSurface, creates a Mach port, and sends
   it to the Swift window.
6. Swift imports the IOSurface, creates a Metal texture, and composites both
   textures in a render pass.
7. On resize, Swift sends new dimensions to each child via XPC. Each child
   creates a new IOSurface at the new size and sends the updated Mach port.

### XPC Protocol

All messages are XPC dictionaries. The protocol is identical for both children.

**Window → Child:**

| Key      | Type   | Description                         |
| -------- | ------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `action` | string | `"resize"`                          |
| `width`  | int64  | Pane width in pixels                |
| `height` | int64  | Pane height in pixels               |
| `scale`  | string | Device scale factor (e.g., `"2.0"`) |

**Child → Window:**

| Key              | Type      | Description              |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------------------------ |
| `action`         | string    | `"frame"`                |
| `iosurface_port` | mach_send | Mach port for IOSurface  |
| `width`          | int64     | Texture width in pixels  |
| `height`         | int64     | Texture height in pixels |

Future extensions (keyboard, mouse, cursor) will use the same channel.

### Endpoint Bootstrapping

XPC anonymous endpoints can't be passed as CLI arguments directly. Instead:

**Option A: Mach bootstrap (preferred)**

1. Swift registers a named Mach service (e.g., `com.termsurf.window.<pid>`).
2. Children connect to the named service.
3. Swift sends each child its dedicated anonymous endpoint via the named
   channel.
4. Children create a new connection from the endpoint for direct communication.

**Option B: Launcher pattern (from ts3)**

1. A launcher process (`com.termsurf.launcher`) acts as a rendezvous point.
2. Swift sends endpoints to the launcher with session IDs.
3. Children claim their endpoints from the launcher.

For this prototype, Option A is simpler. No launcher needed.

**Option C: File descriptor passing**

1. Swift creates a Unix socket pair before spawning each child.
2. Pass one end to the child as a file descriptor.
3. Use the socket for initial handshake, then upgrade to XPC.

Option A is most natural for macOS.

## Implementation Plan

### Swift Window Process

**Framework:** AppKit + Metal (no SwiftUI for the rendering layer)

**Key components:**

```
termsurf-window/
├── Package.swift           (or Xcode project)
├── Sources/
│   ├── main.swift          Entry point
│   ├── WindowController.swift
│   ├── MetalView.swift     NSView subclass with CAMetalLayer
│   ├── Compositor.swift    Metal render pass (two textured quads)
│   ├── XPCManager.swift    Manage child connections
│   └── IOSurfaceImport.swift  IOSurface → MTLTexture
```

**Metal compositing** is straightforward: two textured quads covering the left
and right halves of the viewport. Vertex shader positions them; fragment shader
samples the IOSurface-backed textures.

**IOSurface import** in Swift:

```swift
let surface = IOSurfaceLookupFromMachPort(machPort)
let descriptor = MTLTextureDescriptor.texture2DDescriptor(
    pixelFormat: .bgra8Unorm,
    width: Int(IOSurfaceGetWidth(surface)),
    height: Int(IOSurfaceGetHeight(surface)),
    mipmapped: false
)
let texture = device.makeTexture(
    descriptor: descriptor,
    iosurface: surface,
    plane: 0
)
```

### Rust Child Process (Blue)

**Framework:** wgpu with Metal backend

**Key components:**

```
termsurf-terminal/
├── Cargo.toml
└── src/
    ├── main.rs         Entry point, XPC connection, render loop
    ├── renderer.rs     wgpu setup, blue rectangle render
    └── iosurface.rs    Create IOSurface, render to it, create Mach port
```

**Rendering to IOSurface from wgpu:**

wgpu's Metal backend can create textures from IOSurface via
`hal::metal::Device::texture_from_raw`. The flow:

1. Create an IOSurface (via CoreFoundation C API)
2. Create a Metal texture backed by the IOSurface
3. Wrap it as a wgpu texture via unsafe HAL access
4. Render to it with a standard wgpu render pass (clear to blue)
5. Create a Mach port from the IOSurface
6. Send the Mach port via XPC

**XPC:** Reuse `termsurf-xpc` crate from ts3.

### C++ Child Process (Green)

**Framework:** wgpu-native (C API) or raw Metal (Objective-C++)

**Key components:**

```
termsurf-browser/
├── CMakeLists.txt      (or Makefile)
└── src/
    ├── main.cpp        Entry point, XPC connection, render loop
    ├── renderer.mm     Metal setup, green rectangle render (Obj-C++)
    └── iosurface.mm    Create IOSurface, render to it, create Mach port
```

**Rendering to IOSurface from C++:**

On macOS, the simplest path is Objective-C++ with Metal directly:

1. Create IOSurface via `IOSurfaceCreate()`
2. Create `MTLTexture` from IOSurface via
   `[device newTextureWithDescriptor:iosurface:plane:]`
3. Create a render pass that clears to green
4. Encode and commit the command buffer
5. Create Mach port via `IOSurfaceCreateMachPort()`
6. Send via `xpc_dictionary_set_mach_send()`

**XPC from C++:** libxpc is a C API — call directly from C++ with no wrappers.

Using raw Metal instead of wgpu-native for the C++ process is pragmatic:
Chromium's eventual integration will use Chromium's own GPU pipeline, not wgpu.
The C++ process just needs to produce an IOSurface. How it renders internally
doesn't matter to the window.

## Build System

Three independent builds, no cross-dependencies:

```bash
# Swift window
cd ts4/termsurf-window && swift build
# or: xcodebuild -scheme TermSurf

# Rust terminal (blue pane for now)
cd ts4/termsurf-terminal && cargo build

# C++ browser (green pane for now)
cd ts4/termsurf-browser && make
# or: cmake --build build
```

**Directory structure:**

```
ts4/
├── termsurf-window/        Swift (SwiftPM or Xcode)
│   ├── Package.swift
│   └── Sources/
├── termsurf-terminal/      Rust
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src/
├── termsurf-browser/       C++/Obj-C++
│   ├── Makefile
│   └── src/
└── termsurf-xpc/           Rust XPC library (shared, from ts3)
    ├── Cargo.toml
    └── src/
```

The three binaries are standalone executables. The Swift window spawns the other
two as child processes.

## Success Criteria

1. **Window opens** with a blue left pane and green right pane.
2. **60fps** compositing with no tearing or flickering.
3. **Resize works** — dragging the window edge resizes both panes.
4. **Three processes** visible in Activity Monitor.
5. **Clean shutdown** — closing the window terminates all three processes.
6. **No shared code** between Swift, Rust, and C++ beyond the XPC protocol.

## What This Proves

| Question                                              | Answer                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Can Swift composite IOSurface from foreign processes? | Yes — Metal + IOSurfaceLookupFromMachPort |
| Can Rust render to IOSurface via wgpu?                | Yes — Metal HAL texture_from_raw          |
| Can C++ render to IOSurface via Metal?                | Yes — standard Metal API                  |
| Can XPC transfer Mach ports between Swift/Rust/C++?   | Yes — libxpc is language-agnostic C API   |
| Is 60fps achievable cross-process?                    | Measured (target: <2ms per frame for IPC) |
| Can three build systems coexist?                      | SwiftPM + Cargo + Make, no conflicts      |

## What This Does NOT Prove

- Terminal emulation performance (no VTE, no PTY)
- Chromium embedding feasibility (no Content API)
- Text rendering quality (no fonts, no glyphs)
- Input forwarding latency (no keyboard/mouse events yet)
- Multi-profile process management (no launcher, no profile isolation)

These are separate issues. This prototype validates only the process model, IPC
mechanism, and GPU texture sharing — the foundation everything else builds on.

## Relationship to Other Issues

| Issue                      | Dependency                                                           |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 400 (A New Hope)           | This implements Phase 1 (window + compositor)                        |
| 401 (Chromium feasibility) | Independent — browser research continues in parallel                 |
| 401 (Programming language) | This supersedes 401's recommendation: Swift replaces Rust for window |
| 402 (WezTerm vs Alacritty) | Terminal is out-of-process as recommended; WezTerm crates used later |

## After This Prototype

1. **Replace blue with terminal.** The Rust process uses `wezterm-term` +
   `wezterm-font` + wgpu to render a real terminal instead of a blue rectangle.
   Same IOSurface output, same XPC protocol.

2. **Replace green with browser.** The C++ process uses Chromium Content API to
   render a real webpage instead of a green rectangle. Same IOSurface output,
   same XPC protocol.

3. **Add input forwarding.** Swift sends keyboard and mouse events to the
   focused pane's process via XPC. Same channel, new message types.

4. **Add pane management.** Split, resize, focus, multiple tabs.

The colored rectangles are placeholders. The architecture is the product.

## Implementation Plan

Eight phases, each independently testable. A phase is complete when every
checklist item is checked.

### Phase 1: Create ts4 directory and package skeletons

Create the `ts4/` directory at the repo root with three empty packages that
build successfully. No functionality yet — just the scaffolding.

- [x] Create `ts4/` directory
- [x] Create `ts4/termsurf-window/` as a Swift package (Package.swift +
      Sources/main.swift) that prints "hello from window" and exits
- [x] Create `ts4/termsurf-terminal/` as a Rust package (Cargo.toml +
      src/main.rs) that prints "hello from terminal" and exits
- [x] Create `ts4/termsurf-browser/` as a C++/Obj-C++ package (Makefile +
      src/main.cpp) that prints "hello from browser" and exits
- [x] Copy `ts3/termsurf-xpc/` to `ts4/termsurf-xpc/` for the Rust XPC bindings
- [x] Add `ts4/` build outputs to `.gitignore`

**Test:** Run all three binaries and see their hello messages.

```bash
cd ts4/termsurf-window && swift build && .build/debug/termsurf-window
cd ts4/termsurf-terminal && cargo build && ./target/debug/termsurf-terminal
cd ts4/termsurf-browser && make && ./termsurf-browser
```

### Phase 2: Swift window with Metal rendering

Create a macOS window with a CAMetalLayer that clears to a solid color each
frame. This proves AppKit + Metal works before adding any IPC.

- [x] Create `NSApplication` and `NSWindow` in Swift (no storyboard, no XIB —
      pure code)
- [x] Add an `NSView` subclass backed by `CAMetalLayer`
- [x] Create `MTLDevice` and `MTLCommandQueue`
- [x] Implement a render loop (CVDisplayLink or `MTKView`) that clears the
      drawable to dark gray at 60fps
- [x] Window is resizable and handles resolution changes (Retina)

**Test:** Run `termsurf-window`. A dark gray window appears. Resizing is smooth.
Activity Monitor shows one process. Close the window and the process exits.

### Phase 3: Rust IOSurface rendering

The Rust process creates an IOSurface, renders blue to it via wgpu, and verifies
the result. No XPC yet — just prove that wgpu can render to an IOSurface.

- [ ] Add `wgpu` dependency to `termsurf-terminal/Cargo.toml`
- [ ] Create an IOSurface via CoreFoundation C API (BGRA8, specified width and
      height)
- [ ] Create a Metal texture backed by the IOSurface (via wgpu's Metal HAL
      unsafe API or via `objc`/`metal-rs` crate)
- [ ] Create a wgpu device and queue (Metal backend)
- [ ] Render a clear-to-blue pass targeting the IOSurface-backed texture
- [ ] Read back pixels from the IOSurface and verify they are blue (lock, read,
      unlock)
- [ ] Create a Mach port from the IOSurface via `IOSurfaceCreateMachPort`
- [ ] Print the Mach port number and IOSurface dimensions as confirmation

**Test:** Run `termsurf-terminal`. Output shows the Mach port and confirms blue
pixels were written. No window needed.

```
IOSurface created: 800x600
Rendered blue (0, 0, 255, 255)
Pixel at (0,0): (0, 0, 255, 255) ✓
Mach port: 1234
```

### Phase 4: C++ IOSurface rendering

Same as Phase 3 but in C++/Obj-C++ with raw Metal. No wgpu — the browser process
will eventually use Chromium's GPU pipeline.

- [ ] Create an IOSurface via `IOSurfaceCreate()` (BGRA8, specified width and
      height)
- [ ] Create `MTLDevice` and `MTLCommandQueue`
- [ ] Create `MTLTexture` from the IOSurface via
      `[device newTextureWithDescriptor:iosurface:plane:]`
- [ ] Create a render pass descriptor that clears to green
- [ ] Encode and commit the command buffer, wait for completion
- [ ] Read back pixels from the IOSurface and verify they are green
- [ ] Create a Mach port via `IOSurfaceCreateMachPort()`
- [ ] Print the Mach port number and IOSurface dimensions as confirmation

**Test:** Run `termsurf-browser`. Output confirms green pixels and a valid Mach
port. No window needed.

### Phase 5: XPC between Swift and Rust

Connect the Swift window to the Rust process via XPC. The Rust process sends its
blue IOSurface Mach port. The Swift window imports it and renders it full-screen
(not split yet — that's Phase 7).

- [ ] Swift registers a named Mach service (e.g., `com.termsurf.window.<pid>`)
      or creates an XPC listener
- [ ] Swift spawns `termsurf-terminal` as a child process, passing the service
      name as a CLI argument
- [ ] Rust connects to the named service via `termsurf-xpc`
- [ ] Rust renders blue to IOSurface, creates Mach port, sends XPC message:
      `{ action: "frame", iosurface_port: <port>, width: N, height: N }`
- [ ] Swift receives the message, extracts the Mach port via
      `xpc_dictionary_copy_mach_send`
- [ ] Swift calls `IOSurfaceLookupFromMachPort` to import the IOSurface
- [ ] Swift creates a `MTLTexture` from the imported IOSurface
- [ ] Swift renders the texture as a full-screen quad in its Metal render pass

**Test:** Run `termsurf-window`. A blue window appears. Activity Monitor shows
two processes (`termsurf-window` and `termsurf-terminal`). Closing the window
terminates both.

### Phase 6: XPC between Swift and C++

Same as Phase 5 but with the C++ process. After this phase, Swift can receive
IOSurface from both Rust and C++ — but only one at a time. Split view comes in
Phase 7.

- [ ] Swift spawns `termsurf-browser` as a second child process with its own XPC
      channel
- [ ] C++ connects to the Swift window's XPC service using `libxpc` C API
- [ ] C++ renders green to IOSurface, creates Mach port, sends XPC message:
      `{ action: "frame", iosurface_port: <port>, width: N, height: N }`
- [ ] Swift receives the message and imports the IOSurface as a Metal texture
- [ ] Swift renders the C++ texture as a full-screen quad (temporarily replacing
      the Rust texture, or displayed alongside — either confirms it works)

**Test:** Run `termsurf-window`. A green window appears (or green replaces
blue). Activity Monitor shows three processes. Closing the window terminates all
three.

### Phase 7: Two-pane compositor

Composite both textures side by side in the Swift window. This is the target
state described in the product requirements.

- [ ] Swift Metal render pass draws two textured quads: left half (Rust/blue)
      and right half (C++/green)
- [ ] Vertex shader positions quads at `[-1, -1] to [0, 1]` (left) and
      `[0, -1] to [1, 1]` (right)
- [ ] Fragment shader samples from the correct IOSurface-backed texture for each
      quad
- [ ] Both child processes send frames; Swift composites them in the same render
      pass
- [ ] Frame timing: Swift renders at display refresh rate (CVDisplayLink), using
      the latest IOSurface from each child
- [ ] Measure and log compositing performance (time from IOSurface receive to
      present, target: <2ms)

**Test:** Run `termsurf-window`. Window shows blue on the left, green on the
right. Three processes in Activity Monitor. No tearing, no flickering. Console
logs show frame times.

### Phase 8: Resize

Swift sends resize events to children via XPC. Each child creates a new
IOSurface at the new dimensions and sends the updated Mach port.

- [ ] Swift detects `viewDidEndLiveResize` (or continuous resize via
      `setFrameSize`) and calculates each pane's pixel dimensions
- [ ] Swift sends XPC message to each child:
      `{ action: "resize", width: N, height: N, scale: "2.0" }`
- [ ] Rust receives resize, creates new IOSurface at new size, renders blue,
      sends new Mach port
- [ ] C++ receives resize, creates new IOSurface at new size, renders green,
      sends new Mach port
- [ ] Swift imports the new IOSurfaces and updates the Metal textures
- [ ] Old IOSurfaces are released (no Mach port leak, no IOSurface leak)
- [ ] Deallocate old Mach ports via `mach_port_deallocate`

**Test:** Run `termsurf-window`. Drag the window edge to resize. Both panes
resize proportionally. No stale textures, no black frames during resize. Mach
port count in Activity Monitor stays stable (no leak).

## Phase Completion Summary

| Phase | Description           | Deliverable                               |
| ----- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Directory + skeletons | Three hello-world binaries that build     |
| 2     | Swift Metal window    | A dark gray window at 60fps               |
| 3     | Rust IOSurface        | Blue pixels in an IOSurface, verified     |
| 4     | C++ IOSurface         | Green pixels in an IOSurface, verified    |
| 5     | Swift ↔ Rust XPC      | Blue window from cross-process texture    |
| 6     | Swift ↔ C++ XPC       | Green received from cross-process texture |
| 7     | Two-pane compositor   | Blue left, green right, one window        |
| 8     | Resize                | Panes resize with the window              |

After Phase 8, the system described in Issue 403 is complete. The architecture
is proven. The next step is replacing the colored rectangles with real content
(terminal and browser).
