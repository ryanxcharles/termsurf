# Issue 627: CALayerHost Resize

## Goal

Make the browser overlay resize correctly when the user resizes the window or
pane. The overlay should track the TUI viewport at all times, matching the
behavior that worked flawlessly before the CALayerHost migration.

## Background

### How we got here

[Issue 625](625-calayerhost.md) replaced the `FrameSinkVideoCapturer` pipeline
with `CALayerHost`. Instead of capturing IOSurface frames at 120fps and
transferring Mach ports over XPC every frame, Chromium now sends a
`ca_context_id` (uint32) once per tab. The GUI creates a `CALayerHost` sublayer
on the IOSurfaceLayer, and Window Server composites the remote content directly
from GPU VRAM. Zero per-frame IPC, zero pixel copies.

[Issue 626](626-x-y-calayerhost.md) fixed the X/Y positioning of the CALayerHost
overlay. Six experiments revealed two coordinate system bugs: a missing
intermediate flipped layer and a bottom-origin Y coordinate system on the
IOSurfaceLayer. The overlay is now pixel-perfect at initial placement.

### What broke

Before CALayerHost, resize worked flawlessly. The full chain was in place:

1. User resizes window/pane
2. TUI detects the new terminal dimensions
3. TUI sends `set_overlay` XPC with updated grid coordinates and dimensions
4. GUI receives `set_overlay`, stores new grid coordinates, computes pixel
   dimensions, and forwards the resize to Chromium
5. Chromium renders at the new size
6. The Metal shader composited the IOSurface at the new grid coordinates every
   frame in `drawFrame()`

Step 6 is what changed. The old IOSurface pipeline re-read the overlay grid
coordinates every frame and rendered the Metal shader at the current position
and size. Resize was automatic — update the coordinates and the next frame
renders correctly.

With CALayerHost, there is no per-frame rendering. The `flipped_layer` has a
static frame set once by `updateCALayerHostFrame()`. When the pane resizes, the
XPC messages still flow (steps 1–5 still work), but the `flipped_layer` frame is
not updated to reflect the new dimensions.

### The resize chain today

```
TUI sends set_overlay (new grid coords)
    │
    ▼
xpc.zig handleSetOverlay() — stores grid coords, computes pixel dims
    │
    ▼
Surface.setOverlay() — updates renderer overlay_grid_* fields
    │
    ▼
renderer.updateCALayerHostFrame() — sets flipped_layer.frame
    │
    ▼
Metal.updateCALayerHostFrame() — converts grid→points, Y-flip, sets frame
```

The chain looks correct on paper — `setOverlay()` calls
`updateCALayerHostFrame()` which should update the `flipped_layer` frame. But
something in this path fails on resize. Either the `flipped_layer` pointer is
null at that point, the parent bounds are stale, or the new coordinates don't
produce the correct frame.

### Current layer tree (from Issue 626)

```
IOSurfaceLayer (geometryFlipped=false, Y=0 at bottom)
└─ flipped_layer (geometryFlipped=YES, anchorPoint=zero, auto-fill mask,
│                  explicit frame at overlay rect)
   └─ CALayerHost (anchorPoint=zero, pinned top-left via mask, at origin)
```

The `flipped_layer` frame is set via:

```zig
y_from_top = grid_row * cell_height / scale + padding_top / scale
y = parent_bounds.height - y_from_top - h
```

On resize, `parent_bounds.height` changes (the IOSurfaceLayer resizes with the
window). The grid coordinates, cell dimensions, and padding may also change. All
of these must be current when `updateCALayerHostFrame()` runs.

### What was accidentally removed

The Issue 625 CALayerHost commit (`3313dd352688e`) removed two pieces of the
resize pipeline that were working:

**GUI side (`gui/src/apprt/xpc.zig`):**

- `sendResize()` — sent `"resize"` XPC action with `pixel_width`/`pixel_height`
  to Chromium when an existing pane's overlay dimensions changed.
- The call to `sendResize()` in the existing-pane path of `handleSetOverlay()`.

**Chromium side (`shell_browser_main_parts.cc`):**

- The `"resize"` XPC action handler that dispatched to `ResizeCapture()`.
- `ResizeCapture()` — looked up the tab by pane_id, called
  `view->SetSize(logical)` to resize the WebContents, and resized the capturer
  via `SetResolution()`.

The capturer resize (`SetResolution()`) is no longer needed — there's no
capturer with CALayerHost. But `view->SetSize()` is still essential. It tells
Chromium to re-render at the new dimensions, and the CAContext automatically
reflects the new size via Window Server compositing.

## Experiments

### Experiment 1: Restore resize pipeline and update flipped_layer on size change

Two things are broken:

1. **Chromium doesn't know about resizes.** The `sendResize()` function and
   Chromium's `"resize"` handler were removed in the CALayerHost commit. The GUI
   stores updated pixel dimensions but never sends them to Chromium.

2. **The flipped_layer frame doesn't update on window resize.** The
   `drawFrame()` loop detects `size_changed` and updates screen uniforms, but
   never calls `updateCALayerHostFrame()`. The `setOverlay()` XPC path does call
   it, but the IOSurfaceLayer's parent bounds may be stale at that point due to
   timing.

#### Changes

**Chromium branch:** Create `146.0.7650.0-issue-627` from
`146.0.7650.0-issue-625`. Update `docs/chromium.md`.

**`chromium/src/content/chromium_profile_server/browser/shell_browser_main_parts.cc`:**

- Restore the `"resize"` XPC action handler in `StartDynamicMode()`. Dispatch to
  `ResizeTab()` (renamed from `ResizeCapture` — no capturer to resize).
- Add `ResizeTab()`: look up the tab by pane_id, call `view->SetSize(logical)`.
  No capturer resize needed.

**`gui/src/apprt/xpc.zig`:**

- Restore `sendResize()`: send `"resize"` action with pane_id, pixel_width,
  pixel_height to the Chromium server.
- Restore the call in `handleSetOverlay()`'s existing-pane path: if the tab has
  been sent and dimensions changed, call `sendResize()`.

**`gui/src/renderer/generic.zig`:**

- In `drawFrame()`, after the `size_changed` block (after
  `self.updateScreenSizeUniforms()`), add `self.updateCALayerHostFrame()`. The
  method guards on `ca_layer_flipped` being non-null, so it's a no-op without an
  overlay.

#### Verification

Run the app, open a browser overlay, then resize the window. The web content
should resize and reposition to match the TUI viewport border. Chromium should
log `Resized pane ... to ...` on each resize. Test horizontal resize, vertical
resize, and window maximize/restore.

#### Results

**Pass.** Resize works. The browser overlay tracks the TUI viewport on window
resize.

#### Conclusion

Two things were broken:

1. The `sendResize()` function and Chromium's `"resize"` handler had been
   accidentally removed in the CALayerHost commit. Restoring them lets Chromium
   re-render at the new dimensions.

2. The `flipped_layer` frame was never updated when the surface size changed.
   Adding `updateCALayerHostFrame()` to the `size_changed` path in `drawFrame()`
   ensures the layer repositions on every resize.

## Conclusion

Resize was working before the CALayerHost migration. The Issue 625 commit
accidentally removed `sendResize()` (GUI) and the `"resize"` XPC handler +
`ResizeCapture()` (Chromium). Restoring both — with `ResizeTab()` replacing
`ResizeCapture()` since there's no capturer to resize — plus adding a
`flipped_layer` frame update in `drawFrame()` on size change, fully restores
resize behavior.
