# Issue 642: Zig Profile Server

## Goal

Rewrite the Chromium Profile Server in Zig. Keep a thin C++ shim for Content API
subclassing (the only thing that requires C++), but move all application logic —
XPC handling, tab lifecycle, input routing, navigation, state notifications —
into Zig. The result is a new build target called `zig_profile_server` that
replaces `chromium_profile_server`.

## Background

### Why rewrite in Zig

The current Chromium Profile Server is a Content Shell fork: ~100 C++ files, of
which ~1,050 lines are TermSurf-specific logic. The rest is unmodified Content
Shell boilerplate. Three reasons to rewrite:

1. **Language consistency.** The GUI is written in Zig. The profile server is
   the only TermSurf component written in C++. Having both in Zig means one
   language to maintain, one set of idioms, one mental model.

2. **Maintainability.** The Content Shell fork carries 100+ files we never
   modify. Every Chromium upgrade risks conflicts in boilerplate we don't own. A
   thin C++ shim (3 files) with Zig logic is easier to understand, modify, and
   upgrade.

3. **Developer experience.** Zig is more modern and more enjoyable to work in
   than C++. Comptime, explicit allocators, no header files, no preprocessor
   soup. The same reasons we chose Zig for the GUI apply here.

### What Issue 620 proved

Issue 620 built a minimal Chromium embedder (3 files, ~190 lines) that drives
the Content API through a C function boundary. 15 experiments proved:

- The Content API can be driven from a C `main()` via dlopen/dlsym
- Multiple BrowserContexts coexist in one process with isolated storage
- A custom launcher with zero Chromium headers can create profiles, tabs, and
  manage lifecycle through C function pointers
- `WebContents` can be created directly and their NSView attached to custom
  windows

The in-process multi-profile goal was shelved (Blink main thread scheduling
blocks 60fps for JS-heavy pages across two BrowserContexts — Issue 621). But the
C API shim architecture is exactly what we need for the out-of-process Zig
Profile Server.

### What Issue 620 did NOT cover

Issue 620's shim was a proof-of-concept. It did not implement:

- XPC communication (the gateway connection, message dispatch, response sending)
- Input forwarding (mouse, keyboard, scroll events → RenderWidgetHost)
- CALayerHost / persistent compositor (CAContext stability across navigation)
- WebContents observation (URL, title, loading state, cursor changes)
- Dock icon hiding, focus management, auto-exit
- Navigation actions (back, forward, reload, navigate-to-URL)
- New-tab link interception (redirect to same tab)
- Page title sync

All of these currently live in C++ in the Content Shell fork. They need to move
to Zig.

### What the current profile server does

The Chromium Profile Server runs out-of-process and:

1. **Accepts XPC commands** from the GUI: create/destroy tabs, navigate, resize,
   set focus, forward input events
2. **Observes WebContents** for URL, title, loading state, cursor changes and
   sends updates back via XPC
3. **Forwards input** (mouse, keyboard, scroll) from XPC messages to Chromium
   via the Content API's RenderWidgetHost
4. **Renders via persistent compositor** with stable CAContext — no
   `ca_context_id` flicker on navigation (Issue 633)
5. **Manages visibility/focus** to keep the compositor at full framerate
6. **Intercepts new-tab links** and redirects them to the current tab
   (Issue 639)
7. **Hides the Dock icon** via LSUIElement and runtime NSApplication policy

### Current file structure

The profile server lives at `chromium/src/content/chromium_profile_server/` with
~100 files inherited from Content Shell. TermSurf-specific logic (~1,050 lines)
is spread across:

| File                                     | Lines | What it does                                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `browser/shell_browser_main_parts.cc`    | ~590  | XPC gateway, tab/profile lifecycle, persistent compositor |
| `browser/shell_tab_observer.cc`          | ~200  | URL/title/loading/cursor notifications                    |
| `browser/shell.cc`                       | ~150  | Input forwarding, new-tab interception                    |
| `browser/shell_compositor_bridge_mac.mm` | ~60   | Persistent compositor bridge                              |
| Various                                  | ~50   | Dock hiding, focus, auto-exit                             |

## Architecture

### C++ shim (inside `chromium/src/`)

A thin C++ layer (~3 files) that subclasses Content API virtual classes and
exports C functions. This is the same pattern as Issue 620's `content_api_shim`,
extended to cover the full feature set. Must live inside `chromium/src/` because
GN can only see files rooted there.

The shim handles:

- `ContentMainDelegate`, `ContentBrowserClient`, `BrowserMainParts` subclassing
- `WebContentsDelegate`, `WebContentsObserver` subclassing
- `BrowserContext` lifecycle
- Lifecycle callbacks (initialized, shutdown)
- All forwarding to/from Zig via C function pointers

The shim does NOT contain application logic. It is mechanical glue.

### Zig profile server (in the main repo)

All application logic lives in Zig:

- XPC gateway connection and message dispatch
- Tab lifecycle (create, destroy, navigate)
- Input event translation and forwarding (via C shim functions)
- WebContents state observation callbacks (URL, title, loading, cursor)
- Persistent compositor management
- CAContext ID extraction and reporting
- Dock icon hiding
- Focus management
- Auto-exit when all tabs close
- New-tab link interception

### C API surface

Based on Issue 620's proven API, extended for the full feature set:

```c
/* Initialization */
int ts_content_main(int argc, const char** argv);
void ts_set_on_initialized(void (*callback)(void));
void ts_set_on_shutdown(void (*callback)(void));

/* Profile management */
typedef void* ts_browser_context_t;
ts_browser_context_t ts_create_browser_context(const char* path);
void ts_destroy_browser_context(ts_browser_context_t ctx);

/* Tab management */
typedef void* ts_web_contents_t;
ts_web_contents_t ts_create_web_contents(ts_browser_context_t ctx,
                                         const char* url);
void ts_destroy_web_contents(ts_web_contents_t wc);

/* Navigation */
void ts_load_url(ts_web_contents_t wc, const char* url);
void ts_go_back(ts_web_contents_t wc);
void ts_go_forward(ts_web_contents_t wc);
void ts_reload(ts_web_contents_t wc);

/* Input */
void ts_forward_mouse_event(ts_web_contents_t wc, int type,
                            int x, int y, int button, int mods);
void ts_forward_scroll_event(ts_web_contents_t wc,
                             int x, int y, float dx, float dy,
                             int phase, int mods);
void ts_forward_key_event(ts_web_contents_t wc, int type,
                          int keycode, const char* text, int mods);
void ts_set_focus(ts_web_contents_t wc, bool focused);

/* Display */
uint32_t ts_get_ca_context_id(ts_web_contents_t wc);
void ts_set_view_size(ts_web_contents_t wc, int width, int height);

/* Lifecycle */
void ts_quit(void);

/* Callbacks (Zig registers these before calling ts_content_main) */
void ts_set_on_navigation_committed(
    void (*cb)(ts_web_contents_t wc, const char* url));
void ts_set_on_loading_state_changed(
    void (*cb)(ts_web_contents_t wc, bool loading, float progress));
void ts_set_on_cursor_changed(
    void (*cb)(ts_web_contents_t wc, int cursor_type));
void ts_set_on_title_changed(
    void (*cb)(ts_web_contents_t wc, const char* title));
void ts_set_on_ca_context_id_changed(
    void (*cb)(ts_web_contents_t wc, uint32_t ca_context_id));
```

### Build

Two-step build, same as Issue 620:

1. Build the C++ shim inside Chromium (produces shared library):

   ```bash
   cd chromium/src
   autoninja -C out/Default zig_profile_server_shim
   ```

2. Build the Zig profile server (links against the shim):
   ```bash
   cd browser
   zig build
   ```

The Zig binary dlopen's the shim framework, dlsym's all C API symbols, registers
callbacks, and calls `ts_content_main`. Same pattern proven in Issue 620
Experiment 4.

## Relationship to Issue 620

Issue 620 proved the architecture. This issue builds the production
implementation. The key differences:

## Plan

### Stage 1: C++ shim with minimal Zig launcher

Build the C++ shim inside `chromium/src/content/zig_profile_server/` with the
core API (init, profile, tab, quit). Write a minimal Zig launcher that dlopen's
the shim, creates one profile, loads one page, and displays it in a Shell
window. Prove the Issue 620 Experiment 4 result still works.

### Stage 2: Direct WebContents and CAContext

Extend the shim with `ts_create_web_contents`, `ts_get_ca_context_id`,
`ts_set_view_size`. The Zig launcher creates WebContents directly (no Shell
window) and reports the CAContext ID. Prove the display pipeline works.

### Stage 3: XPC gateway in Zig

Implement the XPC gateway connection in Zig. The Zig profile server connects to
the GUI's XPC listener and begins accepting commands. Port the create-tab,
destroy-tab, and resize XPC handlers from C++ to Zig.

### Stage 4: Input forwarding

Port mouse, keyboard, and scroll event forwarding. The Zig code receives XPC
input messages and calls the C shim's `ts_forward_*` functions.

### Stage 5: WebContents observation

Port URL, title, loading state, and cursor change observation. The C++ shim
fires callbacks into Zig, which sends XPC messages back to the GUI.

### Stage 6: Navigation and remaining features

Port navigation actions (back, forward, reload, navigate-to-URL), new-tab link
interception, dock icon hiding, focus management, and auto-exit.

### Stage 7: Replace chromium_profile_server

Once the Zig Profile Server has feature parity, switch the GUI to connect to it
instead of the C++ profile server. Remove the old `chromium_profile_server`
target.
