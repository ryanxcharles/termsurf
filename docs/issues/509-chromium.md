# Issue 509: Chromium Streaming (Retry)

## Background

Issue 507 proved the full Chromium pipeline works end-to-end. In Experiment 4,
the box-demo (blue spinning square at `http://localhost:9407`) rendered inside a
TermSurf pane at 58-60fps for approximately three seconds before crashing. Every
piece of the pipeline ran successfully:

1. **`web` TUI** sent viewport grid coordinates and URL to the app via XPC.
2. **TermSurf app** spawned the Chromium Profile Server and forwarded the URL.
3. **Chromium Profile Server** connected to the app via the xpc-gateway's
   two-step endpoint handoff, navigated to the URL, and captured frames with
   `FrameSinkVideoCapturer` at 1600x1200 (Retina).
4. **IOSurface Mach ports** streamed at 60fps from the server to the app over
   the direct XPC connection.
5. **Metal renderer** created MTLTextures from the IOSurfaces and composited
   them at the correct grid coordinates inside the terminal pane.

The crash was an IOSurface use-after-free across the Swift/Zig boundary. When a
new frame arrived (every ~16ms), Swift replaced `currentSurfaces[uuid]` with the
new IOSurface. ARC released the previous one while the Zig renderer still held a
raw pointer to it.

Issue 508 solved this. Five experiments traced the path from misdiagnosis
(blamed a race condition) through lost logs (stderr discarded by `open`) to the
actual root cause: **Metal requires `bytesPerRow` to be a multiple of 16 for
IOSurface-backed textures.** The fix was one line:
`(pixelWidth * 4 + 15) & ~15`. Along the way, Issue 508 also established:

- **CFRetain/CFRelease on the Zig side** — when the renderer receives a new
  IOSurface pointer, it calls `CFRetain` on the new one and `CFRelease` on the
  old one. This gives Zig its own ownership stake independent of Swift ARC.
- **`open --stderr <path>`** as the standard debugging approach for TermSurf (no
  source code changes needed to capture logs).
- **`Texture.fromIOSurface()`** — zero-copy MTLTexture creation from an
  IOSurface reference, created per-frame (correct pattern for streaming
  content).

### What exists now

### What Issue 507 built but reverted

Issue 507 Experiments 3-4 added Chromium-specific code to three components. This
code was reverted along with all of Issue 507's overlay changes when that issue
concluded. Issue 508 reimplemented the overlay infrastructure (shaders,
pipeline, `Texture.fromIOSurface`, CFRetain/CFRelease, cell size API) but did
NOT reimplement the Chromium-specific pieces:

1. **CompositorXPC.swift — server lifecycle management.** Spawning the Chromium
   Profile Server process, handling `server_register` and `display_surface`
   messages, forwarding `create_tab` commands, killing the server on `web`
   disconnect. Currently the Swift code only creates a static checkerboard
   IOSurface.

2. **Chromium Profile Server — two-step gateway connect.** The server
   (`shell_browser_main_parts.cc`) needs to connect to the app via the
   xpc-gateway's endpoint relay instead of connecting to a named Mach service
   directly. The Chromium branch `146.0.7650.0-issue-507` has this code but it
   was never merged into the main Chromium branch.

3. **`web` TUI — URL in `set_overlay`.** The `web` process needs to include the
   URL in its `set_overlay` messages so the app knows what page to load. The
   current `send_set_overlay` doesn't include a `url` field.

### What Issue 507 learned

- **`base::CommandLine` requires `=` syntax.** Chromium's command-line parser
  only supports `--flag=value`, not `--flag value`. Process arguments must be
  joined with `=`.
- **The full pipeline runs at 60fps.** Before the crash,
  `FrameSinkVideoCapturer` sustained 58-60fps with 1600x1200 Retina frames
  streaming over XPC.
- __`freopen` only redirects C FILE_ stderr._* Zig writes to fd 2 directly via
  `std.debug.print`, bypassing the C FILE layer. `open --stderr <path>`
  redirects fd 2 at the OS level, capturing everything.

### What Issue 508 fixed

- **bytesPerRow alignment:** `(pixelWidth * 4 + 15) & ~15` for IOSurface-backed
  Metal textures.
- **IOSurface lifetime:** CFRetain on the Zig side when receiving a new
  IOSurface, CFRelease on the old one, all under `draw_mutex`.
- **Resize stability:** The checkerboard IOSurface survives terminal resize
  without crashing.

## Goal

`cargo run -p web -- http://localhost:9407` renders the box-demo (blue spinning
square with FPS counter) inside a TermSurf pane at 60fps. The page renders at
the viewport's grid coordinates, composited by the Metal renderer using the
IOSurface overlay pipeline.

This is the same goal as Issue 507 — but now the IOSurface lifetime management
and bytesPerRow alignment are solved. The crash that ended Issue 507 Experiment
4 after three seconds should not recur.

### Scope

- Single default profile only.
- No resize of the Chromium viewport (the server captures at a fixed size; the
  overlay stretches to fit).
- No URL editing or re-navigation.
- No keyboard/mouse input forwarding to the browser.

### Not in scope

- Multiple browser profiles.
- Retina size matching (viewport pixel dimensions sent to server for
  `SetResolutionConstraints`).
- Dynamic resize (updating capture resolution when the terminal resizes).
- Input forwarding (keyboard, mouse, scroll).

## Process Topology

```
web TUI ────direct XPC────▶ TermSurf app ──spawns──▶ Chromium Profile Server
              (via xpc-gateway               (connects back to app
               endpoint handoff)              via xpc-gateway)

xpc-gateway (com.termsurf.xpc-gateway)
  - Pure rendezvous, no ongoing traffic
  - App registers anonymous listener endpoint
  - web + server both claim endpoint, connect directly to app
```

## Connection Flow

```
1. App starts:     registers endpoint with xpc-gateway

2. web starts:     connects to xpc-gateway → gets endpoint → connects to app
                   sends set_overlay (grid coords + URL) on direct connection

3. App receives:   stores overlay grid coords
                   spawns Chromium Profile Server for the pane

4. Server starts:  connects to xpc-gateway → gets endpoint → connects to app
                   sends server_register (pane_id)
                   app sends create_tab (URL) to server
                   server navigates to URL
                   FrameSinkVideoCapturer captures frames

5. Frame arrives:  server sends display_surface (IOSurface Mach port) to app
                   app imports IOSurface via IOSurfaceLookupFromMachPort
                   app calls ghostty_surface_set_overlay_iosurface
                   Zig renderer CFRetains new, CFReleases old
                   drawFrame() creates MTLTexture from IOSurface, renders quad

6. web exits:      drops XPC connection
                   app kills server, clears overlay, CFReleases IOSurface
```

## XPC Protocol

### `web` to app (direct connection)

**Set overlay (extended with URL):**

```
{ action: "set_overlay", pane_id: "<uuid>",
  col: N, row: N, width: N, height: N,
  url: "http://localhost:9407" }
```

### App to Chromium Profile Server (direct connection)

**Create tab:**

```
{ action: "create_tab", url: "http://localhost:9407", tab_id: "<uuid>" }
```

### Chromium Profile Server to app (direct connection)

**Server register:**

```
{ action: "server_register", pane_id: "<uuid>" }
```

**Display surface (at 60fps):**

```
{ action: "display_surface", pane_id: "<uuid>",
  iosurface_port: <mach_send_right>,
  width: N, height: N }
```

## Components to Change

### 1. CompositorXPC.swift — Server lifecycle + display_surface handler

The current `set_overlay` handler creates a static checkerboard IOSurface. This
must be extended to:

- Detect the `url` field in `set_overlay`
- Spawn a Chromium Profile Server process (with `=`-joined flags)
- Handle `server_register` from the server (store the control connection)
- Forward `create_tab` with the URL
- Handle `display_surface` (import IOSurface from Mach port, pass to renderer)
- Kill the server and clean up on `web` disconnect

The checkerboard code can remain as a fallback or be replaced entirely.

### 2. Chromium Profile Server — Two-step gateway connect

The server's `StartDynamicMode` in `shell_browser_main_parts.cc` currently
connects to a named Mach service. It must be changed to the two-step gateway
connect (same pattern as `web/src/xpc.rs`):

1. Connect to `com.termsurf.xpc-gateway`
2. Send `{ action: "connect" }`, receive endpoint in reply
3. Create connection from endpoint
4. Send `server_register` on the direct connection
5. Wait for `create_tab` commands from the app

The `--pane-id` flag must be added so the server can identify itself.

### 3. `web` TUI — Include URL in set_overlay

The `send_set_overlay` function in `web/src/xpc.rs` must include the URL string.
The `web/src/main.rs` call site must pass the URL from the command-line
argument.

### 4. Chromium branch

The `146.0.7650.0-issue-507` branch in the Chromium fork has the two-step
gateway connect and `--pane-id` code from Issue 507 Experiment 3. This can be
used as a starting point (or a new branch can be created from
`146.0.7650.0-issue-503`).

## Build

```bash
# Build Chromium Profile Server
cd chromium/src
export PATH="$(cd ../depot_tools && pwd):$PATH"
autoninja -C out/Default chromium_profile_server

# Build xpc-gateway
cd ts5/xpc-gateway && swift build

```

## Verification

```bash
# Start the box-demo server
cd ts4/box-demo && bun run server.ts &

# Launch the app
open ts5/zig-out/TermSurf.app

# In a TermSurf pane:
cargo run -p web -- http://localhost:9407

# Expected:
# - Blue spinning square visible in viewport
# - FPS counter on the page shows ~60fps
# - No crash (the IOSurface lifetime fix from Issue 508 prevents it)
# - Quitting web (q or Ctrl+C) clears the overlay and kills the server
#
# Debugging:
# open ts5/zig-out/TermSurf.app --stderr ~/dev/termsurf/logs/overlay.log
```
