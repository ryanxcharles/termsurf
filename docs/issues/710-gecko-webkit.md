# Issue 710: Gecko & WebKit engine research

## Goal

Determine what it takes to build Roamium equivalents for Gecko (Firefox) and
WebKit (Safari). Each engine gets a C shared library wrapping its embedding API,
plus a Rust binary that links the library and speaks the TermSurf protocol.

The end state is three browser backends — one per engine — all compatible with
the same board (GUI, Wezboard, etc.):

| Engine   | C library              | Rust binary        | Code name |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ | --------- |
| Chromium | `libtermsurf_chromium` | Roamium            | (done)    |
| Gecko    | `libtermsurf_gecko`    | TBD (e.g., Recko)  | TBD       |
| WebKit   | `libtermsurf_webkit`   | TBD (e.g., Rebkit) | TBD       |

## Background

### Roamium as the template

Roamium (Issue 707) proved the pattern: a ~400-line Rust binary linking a C
shared library (`libtermsurf_chromium`, Issue 708) that wraps the browser
engine's embedding API. The C library exports ~23 functions with C types only
(`ts_init`, `ts_create_tab`, `ts_navigate`, `ts_send_mouse_event`, etc.). The
Rust binary handles Unix socket IPC, protobuf parsing, and process lifecycle.

The same pattern should work for Gecko and WebKit:

1. **C shared library** — Wraps the engine's embedding/content API. Exports
   `ts_*` functions with identical signatures (or as close as possible) to
   `libtermsurf_chromium`. Lives inside the engine's source tree, built with the
   engine's build system.

2. **Rust binary** — Links the C library. Connects to the board via Unix socket.
   Handles the TermSurf protocol (30 messages). Built with Cargo outside the
   engine tree.

### What the C library must do

Based on `libtermsurf_chromium`'s 23 exported functions, the C library for each
engine must support:

- **Initialization** — Start the engine's event loop, create a browser context
  (profile).
- **Tab lifecycle** — Create tabs (web contents), close tabs, resize viewports.
- **Navigation** — Load URLs, handle redirects.
- **Input forwarding** — Mouse events (click, move, scroll), keyboard events
  (keydown, keyup, repeat).
- **Focus management** — Notify the engine when a tab gains/loses focus.
- **GPU compositing** — Provide a `CAContext` ID (macOS) or equivalent surface
  handle for zero-copy compositing via `CALayerHost`.
- **State callbacks** — Notify the Rust binary when URL changes, loading state
  changes, page title changes, cursor type changes, and tab readiness.
- **DevTools** — Open DevTools for a given tab.
- **Color scheme** — Set dark/light mode preference.

### Key research questions

For each engine:

1. **Embedding API** — What is the official embedding API? How mature and stable
   is it? (Chromium has the Content API; Gecko has GeckoView; WebKit has
   WKWebView / WebKitGTK.)

2. **Headless/hidden rendering** — Can the engine render offscreen or to a
   hidden window while still producing GPU output for compositing? (Chromium
   uses `--hidden` flag with `setAlphaValue:0`.)

3. **CAContext / GPU surface** — Can we get a `CAContext` ID or equivalent
   handle for `CALayerHost` compositing? This is the critical path for 60fps
   zero-copy rendering.

4. **Input injection** — Can we programmatically inject mouse and keyboard
   events? At what level? (Chromium uses `RenderWidgetHost::ForwardMouseEvent`
   and `ForwardKeyboardEvent`.)

5. **Callback hooks** — Can we register callbacks for URL changes, loading
   state, title changes, cursor changes? (Chromium uses `WebContentsObserver`
   subclass.)

6. **DevTools** — How does the engine expose DevTools? Can we open DevTools
   programmatically for a specific tab?

7. **Build system** — What build system does the engine use? How do we add a
   shared library target? (Chromium uses GN/Ninja; Gecko uses moz.build/Make;
   WebKit uses CMake.)

8. **Multi-profile** — Can we run multiple browser profiles (separate cookie
   jars, storage) in the same process? (Chromium uses `BrowserContext`; relevant
   for shared session.)

9. **Fork size** — How many files do we need to modify in the engine tree? Can
   we keep the footprint as small as Chromium's (24 files, 8 stock patches)?

10. **Cross-platform** — What platforms does the embedding API support? Does
    compositing work on Linux/Windows?

## Approach

1. Clone both repos into `vendor/`:
   - `vendor/firefox` — Full clone of `mozilla-firefox/firefox`
   - `vendor/webkit` — Full clone of `WebKit/WebKit`

2. Research Gecko's embedding API (GeckoView, libxul, Servo components).

3. Research WebKit's embedding API (WebKitGTK, WKWebView, MiniBrowser).

4. For each engine, map the 10 research questions above to specific source
   locations and answer them.

5. Assess feasibility and estimate the C library surface area for each engine.
