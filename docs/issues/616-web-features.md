# Issue 616: Implement missing web features

## Goal

Systematically identify and implement browser features that are missing from the
current gui/ generation. High-impact features are implemented first. Features
that can't be implemented yet are logged for future work.

## Background

ts1 (WKWebView generation) implemented a comprehensive set of browser features
from v0.3 through v1.0. The current gui/ generation (Chromium via Content API)
has the core streaming pipeline working — live rendering, mouse input, keyboard
input, multi-pane multi-profile — but is missing many user-facing browser
features that ts1 had.

Some ts1 features translate directly to Chromium (downloads, file uploads, JS
dialogs). Others are WKWebView-specific and either aren't needed with Chromium
or require a different approach. This issue catalogs everything and prioritizes
what to build.

### Feature inventory

Features are organized by priority. Priority is based on how often a user would
encounter the missing feature during normal browsing.

#### High priority

These features affect common browsing scenarios. A user will hit these within
minutes of browsing.

| # | Feature                      | ts1 status                       | gui/ status     | Notes                                                                                                               |
| - | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | **target="_blank" handling** | Loads in same view               | Not implemented | Links requesting new windows (OAuth, "Open in new tab") silently fail without this. Very common on modern websites. |
| 2 | **JavaScript dialogs**       | alert/confirm/prompt via NSAlert | Not implemented | Many sites use confirm() for destructive actions, prompt() for input. Sites break without these.                    |
| 3 | **Downloads**                | WKDownloadDelegate + NSSavePanel | Not implemented | Any file download link currently does nothing.                                                                      |
| 4 | **File uploads**             | NSOpenPanel via WKUIDelegate     | Not implemented | `<input type="file">` does nothing without this. Common for profile pictures, attachments, etc.                     |
| 5 | **Page zoom**                | Cmd+=/-/0 via pageZoom           | Not implemented | Users expect standard zoom keybindings.                                                                             |
| 6 | **HTTP Basic Auth**          | NSAlert with username/password   | Not implemented | Password-protected pages show blank or error without this.                                                          |
| 7 | **URL normalization**        | Prepend https://                 | Not implemented | Users type `google.com`, not `https://google.com`. The `web` TUI or Chromium server should handle this.             |

#### Medium priority

These features matter but are encountered less frequently or have workarounds.

| #  | Feature                      | ts1 status                     | gui/ status     | Notes                                                                                                              |
| -- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 8  | **Crash recovery**           | Reload/close dialog            | Not implemented | Chromium renderer crashes are rare but should be handled gracefully.                                               |
| 9  | **Camera/mic permissions**   | Permission prompt              | Not implemented | Only needed for video calls, media recording. Can defer.                                                           |
| 10 | **Console capture**          | JS injection → stdout/stderr   | Not implemented | Useful for developers. The `web` TUI could display console output. Requires Chromium DevTools protocol or similar. |
| 11 | **Web Inspector / DevTools** | Safari Inspector via Cmd+Alt+I | Not implemented | Chromium has DevTools built in, but we need a way to open them (remote debugging port, or in-process).             |

#### Lower priority

These are nice-to-have or may not apply to the Chromium architecture.

| #  | Feature                            | ts1 status                     | gui/ status         | Notes                                                                                      |
| -- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 12 | **User-Agent spoofing**            | Custom Safari UA string        | Probably not needed | Chromium sends a real browser UA by default. Unlikely to get mobile layouts.               |
| 13 | **Header injection**               | Upgrade-Insecure-Requests      | Probably not needed | Chromium sends this header natively. Was a WKWebView-specific workaround.                  |
| 14 | **Blob download workaround**       | JS interceptor for WebKit bug  | Not needed          | This was a WebKit bug. Chromium handles blob: downloads natively.                          |
| 15 | **Session isolation (incognito)**  | Ephemeral WKWebsiteDataStore   | Not implemented     | Chromium supports incognito via BrowserContext. Low urgency — named profiles already work. |
| 16 | **Bookmarking**                    | Cmd+B, file-based JSON storage | Not implemented     | Useful but not critical for initial release.                                               |
| 17 | **JavaScript API (--js-api)**      | window.termsurf.exit(code)     | Not implemented     | Niche feature for scripting. Defer.                                                        |
| 18 | **Hide/show webviews (ctrl+z/fg)** | isHidden property              | Not implemented     | Terminal backgrounding support. Defer.                                                     |
| 19 | **Multi-webview stacking**         | Stack per pane with indicator  | Not implemented     | Multiple webviews per pane. Current architecture is one-per-pane. Defer.                   |
| 20 | **Dynamic tab titles**             | KVO on WKWebView.title         | Not implemented     | Tab shows page title. Requires Chromium to send title updates via XPC.                     |

#### Already implemented (in gui/ or differently)

| Feature               | Notes                                                                |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Profile isolation** | Multi-profile via separate Chromium Profile Servers (Issues 604–605) |
| **Three-mode focus**  | Browse/Control modes with Esc/Enter switching (Issue 607)            |
| **Focus management**  | Chromium focus/blur via XPC (Issue 606)                              |
| **Control bar**       | `web` TUI draws URL bar, status bar (Issue 504)                      |

### Implementation approach

Each feature is a self-contained experiment. Features that require Chromium-side
changes (new XPC messages, new Content API calls) are harder than features that
can be handled entirely in gui/ Zig code or the `web` TUI.

**Chromium-side changes** are needed for: downloads, file uploads, JS dialogs,
HTTP auth, crash recovery, camera/mic permissions, console capture, DevTools,
dynamic tab titles.

**GUI-side only** changes: target="_blank" (if we load in same tab), page zoom,
URL normalization.

## Experiments

### Experiment 1: Unify test pages and audit existing demos

#### Goal

Replace `html/` and `box-demo/` with a single `test-html/` directory containing
a Bun server that serves all test pages. A main index page links to every demo.
Each existing demo is tested in the current gui/ + Chromium pipeline to identify
which features work and which are broken.

#### Background

The repo currently has test HTML scattered across two top-level directories:

- `html/` — 4 standalone HTML files (dialogs, downloads, mouse, uploads)
- `box-demo/` — Bun server + spinning square demo (FPS, localStorage)

These were created ad-hoc during different experiments. They need a single home
with a proper server so we can systematically test browser features.

`ts4/box-demo/` and `ts5/box-demo/` are identical historical copies and are left
as-is.

#### Steps

##### Step 1: Create `test-html/` with Bun server

Create `test-html/server.ts` — a Bun HTTP server that:

- Serves static files from `test-html/public/`
- Runs on port 9616 (Issue 616)
- Has a root route (`/`) that serves an index page with links to all demos

##### Step 2: Create the index page

Create `test-html/public/index.html` — a main page listing all test demos with
links. Organized by feature category matching the inventory in this issue.

##### Step 3: Move existing test pages

Move the existing test pages into `test-html/public/`:

- `html/test-dialogs.html` → `test-html/public/test-dialogs.html`
- `html/test-download.html` → `test-html/public/test-download.html`
- `html/test-mouse.html` → `test-html/public/test-mouse.html`
- `html/test-upload.html` → `test-html/public/test-upload.html`
- `box-demo/public/index.html` → `test-html/public/test-box-demo.html`

##### Step 4: Add new test pages for untested features

Create minimal test pages for features that don't have test pages yet:

- `test-html/public/test-target-blank.html` — Links with `target="_blank"` and
  `window.open()`
- `test-html/public/test-zoom.html` — Text at various sizes to verify zoom
  behavior
- `test-html/public/test-auth.html` — Link to an HTTP Basic Auth endpoint (can
  use httpbin.org or similar)

##### Step 5: Delete old directories

```bash
git rm -r html/
git rm -r box-demo/
```

##### Step 6: Test each demo

Launch TermSurf, run `web http://localhost:9616`, and systematically test each
demo page. Record pass/fail for each:

| Demo              | Feature tested                      | Expected behavior                           | Result |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| test-box-demo     | Canvas rendering, FPS, localStorage | Spinning square at 60fps, identity persists |        |
| test-mouse        | Mouse events                        | Click counter increments, events logged     |        |
| test-dialogs      | alert/confirm/prompt                | Native dialogs appear                       |        |
| test-download     | File downloads                      | Save dialog appears                         |        |
| test-upload       | File uploads                        | File picker opens                           |        |
| test-target-blank | target="_blank" links               | Link loads (in same or new view)            |        |
| test-zoom         | Page zoom                           | Cmd+=/-/0 changes text size                 |        |
| test-auth         | HTTP Basic Auth                     | Login dialog appears                        |        |

#### Verification

1. `bun run test-html/server.ts` starts and serves the index page at
   `http://localhost:9616`
2. All demo pages are accessible from the index
3. `html/` and `box-demo/` are deleted from the repo
4. `ts4/box-demo/` and `ts5/box-demo/` are unchanged
5. Each demo has a pass/fail result recorded in the table above

### Experiment 2: Loading state indicator and pink texture removal

#### Goal

Show a blue progress bar at the top of the terminal pane while a web page is
loading. Remove the pink texture that currently shows during page load. The
progress bar is Ghostty's built-in OSC 9;4 indicator — no custom rendering
needed.

#### Background

When a user navigates to a page, the current experience is:

1. Pink texture fills the pane (the default IOSurface before Chromium sends a
   frame)
2. No indication that anything is happening
3. Page suddenly appears when Chromium sends the first frame

The desired experience is:

1. Blue progress bar pulses at the top of the terminal pane
2. Progress bar shows determinate progress as the page loads
3. Progress bar disappears when the page is fully loaded
4. No pink texture — the pane shows nothing (or the previous page) until the
   first Chromium frame arrives

#### Architecture

Three processes participate, connected by XPC:

```
Chromium Profile Server ──XPC──▶ TermSurf GUI ──XPC──▶ web TUI ──stdout──▶ Ghostty
```

**Chromium Profile Server** detects loading state via `WebContentsObserver`
callbacks and sends XPC messages to the GUI.

**TermSurf GUI** receives loading state from Chromium and relays it to the web
TUI via the existing reverse XPC channel.

**web TUI** receives loading state and emits OSC 9;4 escape sequences to stdout.
Ghostty renders the blue progress bar.

#### XPC message protocol

##### Chromium Profile Server → GUI

New message type: `loading_state`

```
{
  "action":   "loading_state",
  "pane_id":  "<uuid>",
  "state":    "loading" | "progress" | "done" | "error",
  "progress": <uint64 0–100>    // only meaningful when state == "progress"
}
```

Sent at these Chromium events:

| Chromium callback        | `state`      | `progress` | When                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------ | ---------- | --------------------------- |
| `DidStartLoading()`      | `"loading"`  | 0          | Navigation begins           |
| `LoadProgressChanged(p)` | `"progress"` | p × 100    | Periodic during load        |
| `DidStopLoading()`       | `"done"`     | 100        | All frames finished loading |
| `DidFailLoad(...)`       | `"error"`    | 0          | Load failed                 |

##### GUI → web TUI

New message type: `loading_state` (relayed from Chromium)

```
{
  "action":   "loading_state",
  "state":    "loading" | "progress" | "done" | "error",
  "progress": <uint64 0–100>
}
```

The GUI strips `pane_id` (the web TUI already knows which pane it is) and
forwards on the existing `web_peer` connection.

##### web TUI → stdout (terminal escape sequences)

| Received state | OSC 9;4 sequence              | Ghostty renders            |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `"loading"`    | `\x1b]9;4;3\x1b\\`            | Indeterminate blue pulse   |
| `"progress"`   | `\x1b]9;4;1;{progress}\x1b\\` | Determinate blue bar at N% |
| `"done"`       | `\x1b]9;4;0\x1b\\`            | Bar removed                |
| `"error"`      | `\x1b]9;4;2\x1b\\`            | Red error bar              |

#### Changes

##### Chromium Profile Server (branch: `146.0.7650.0-issue-616`)

**File: `content/chromium_profile_server/browser/shell_video_consumer.h`**

Add `WebContentsObserver` method declarations:

- `void DidStartLoading() override;`
- `void DidStopLoading() override;`
- `void LoadProgressChanged(double progress) override;`
- `void DidFailLoad(content::RenderFrameHost*, const GURL&, int) override;`

Add helper:

- `void SendLoadingState(const char* state, int progress);`

**File: `content/chromium_profile_server/browser/shell_video_consumer.cc`**

Implement the four observer methods. Each calls `SendLoadingState()` which
constructs and sends the XPC dictionary:

```cpp
void ShellVideoConsumer::SendLoadingState(const char* state, int progress) {
  if (!xpc_connection_) return;
  xpc_object_t msg = xpc_dictionary_create(NULL, NULL, 0);
  xpc_dictionary_set_string(msg, "action", "loading_state");
  xpc_dictionary_set_string(msg, "pane_id", pane_id_.c_str());
  xpc_dictionary_set_string(msg, "state", state);
  xpc_dictionary_set_uint64(msg, "progress", progress);
  xpc_connection_send_message(xpc_connection_, msg);
  xpc_release(msg);
}
```

##### TermSurf GUI

**File: `gui/src/apprt/xpc.zig`**

Add `"loading_state"` to the `handleMessage` dispatcher. The handler:

1. Reads `pane_id` from the message
2. Looks up the pane
3. Sends a new `loading_state` message to `pane.web_peer` with `state` and
   `progress` fields (no `pane_id` — the TUI knows its own pane)

New function: `handleLoadingState(msg)` — approximately 15 lines following the
same pattern as `sendModeToWeb`.

##### web TUI

**File: `tui/src/xpc.rs`**

Add `LoadingState` variant to `CompositorMessage`:

```rust
pub enum CompositorMessage {
    ModeChanged { browsing: bool },
    UrlChanged { url: String },
    LoadingState { state: String, progress: u8 },
}
```

Add parsing in the event handler block (alongside `mode_changed` and
`url_changed`):

```rust
} else if action == "loading_state" {
    let state_key = CString::new("state").unwrap();
    let state_ptr = unsafe { xpc_dictionary_get_string(event, state_key.as_ptr()) };
    if !state_ptr.is_null() {
        let state = unsafe { CStr::from_ptr(state_ptr) }
            .to_str().unwrap_or("done").to_string();
        let progress_key = CString::new("progress").unwrap();
        let progress = unsafe { xpc_dictionary_get_uint64(event, progress_key.as_ptr()) } as u8;
        let _ = tx.send(CompositorMessage::LoadingState { state, progress });
    }
}
```

**File: `tui/src/main.rs`**

Add OSC 9;4 emission when `LoadingState` is received:

```rust
CompositorMessage::LoadingState { state, progress } => {
    match state.as_str() {
        "loading" => write!(stdout, "\x1b]9;4;3\x1b\\")?,
        "progress" => write!(stdout, "\x1b]9;4;1;{}\x1b\\", progress)?,
        "done" => write!(stdout, "\x1b]9;4;0\x1b\\")?,
        "error" => write!(stdout, "\x1b]9;4;2\x1b\\")?,
        _ => {}
    }
    stdout.flush()?;
}
```

##### Pink texture removal

**File: `gui/src/renderer/Metal.zig`** (or wherever the pink fallback texture is
created)

Remove or replace the pink fallback color. Options:

- Set the fallback to transparent (clear color)
- Skip rendering the overlay entirely when no IOSurface has been received yet
- Show nothing until the first `display_surface` message arrives

The exact approach depends on how the overlay pipeline handles the "no surface
yet" state. The simplest change is making the initial clear color transparent
instead of pink.

#### Verification

1. Launch TermSurf, run `web http://localhost:9616`
2. **Loading indicator**: While the page loads, a blue progress bar pulses at
   the top of the terminal pane
3. **Progress updates**: For slow-loading pages, the bar shows determinate
   progress (0%–100%)
4. **Completion**: The bar disappears when the page finishes loading
5. **No pink**: No pink texture visible at any point during page load
6. **Error state**: Navigating to an invalid URL shows a red error bar briefly
7. **Subsequent navigations**: Clicking a link on the loaded page triggers the
   progress bar again

**Result:** Pass

The loading indicator works end-to-end: Chromium sends `loading_state` via XPC,
the GUI relays it to the web TUI, and the TUI emits OSC 9;4 which Ghostty
renders as a blue progress bar. The pink fallback texture is removed — the pane
shows nothing until Chromium sends its first frame.

However, there is a critical issue: **the longest wait is Chromium process
startup, not page loading.** When the user runs `web google.com` for the first
time, the Chromium Profile Server process must launch before any page can load.
This cold start takes significantly longer than loading google.com itself. The
loading indicator only appears briefly after Chromium is already running and the
page load begins. During the much longer Chromium startup phase, the user sees
no progress indication at all.

#### Conclusion

The Chromium-to-TUI loading pipeline works. The next experiment must address the
cold-start gap: the web TUI should show the progress bar immediately when
waiting for Chromium to start, not only after Chromium is running and reports
`DidStartLoading`. This can be done entirely in the GUI or TUI — the TUI can
emit OSC 9;4;3 (indeterminate pulse) as soon as it sends `set_overlay`, and
clear it when the first `loading_state` or `display_surface` arrives.
