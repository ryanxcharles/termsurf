# Issue 706: Fix DevTools crash in Plusium

## Goal

Make Chrome DevTools work in Plusium. Currently, opening DevTools crashes
Plusium with a SEGV inside `ShellDevToolsBindings::AttachInternal()`. The same
DevTools code path works in the Chromium Profile Server. This issue debugs and
fixes the crash so DevTools works identically in Plusium.

## Background

### What works

Plusium is a standalone C++ binary (`content/plusium/plusium_main.cc`) that
wraps Chromium's Content API through `libtermsurf_content`, a C library that
subclasses `ContentMainDelegate`, `ContentBrowserClient`, `BrowserMainParts`,
etc. Regular browser tabs work end-to-end: the TUI sends
`web google.com --browser plusium`, the GUI spawns Plusium, Chromium renders the
page, CALayerHost composites it into the terminal pane at 60fps. Navigation,
input forwarding, URL sync, title sync, loading state — all functional.

The IPC routing for DevTools is also correct (Issue 705 Experiment 10). The
GUI's `QueryDevtoolsReply` returns the browser and profile of the inspected tab,
the TUI passes them through, and `handleSetDevtoolsOverlay` routes
`CreateDevtoolsTab` to the correct Plusium process via `tab_to_pane` lookup.

### The crash

When DevTools is requested, the full chain works up to the point where
`ShellDevToolsBindings` tries to attach to the inspected tab:

1. TUI sends `set_devtools_overlay` with `inspected_tab_id=1`
2. GUI looks up tab 1 in `tab_to_pane`, finds the Plusium server, sends
   `CreateDevtoolsTab`
3. Plusium receives the message, `FindByTabId(1)` succeeds
4. `TsBrowserMainParts::CreateDevToolsTab` creates a Shell with the DevTools
   URL, does all compositor/observer setup, then creates
   `new ShellDevToolsFrontend(shell, inspected_wc)`
5. The DevTools frontend page loads, `PrimaryMainDocumentElementAvailable`
   fires, calling `devtools_bindings_->Attach()`
6. `ShellDevToolsBindings::AttachInternal()` calls
   `DevToolsAgentHost::GetOrCreateForTab(inspected_contents_)`
7. **SEGV** inside `WebContentsDevToolsAgentHost::InnerAttach(WebContents*)` at
   a corrupted address (`a7fe5f1dbd82658f`)

The crash signature is `SEGV_ACCERR` — accessing memory at a clearly invalid
pointer. This happened in both Experiment 10 (which used `Show()`) and
Experiment 12 (which matched Profile Server's manual pattern). The crash point
moved slightly between experiments but the root cause is the same: the inspected
`WebContents*` pointer is corrupted or stale by the time the DevTools bindings
try to attach.

### Why Profile Server works

The Chromium Profile Server (`content/chromium_profile_server/`) is a monolithic
C++ binary that owns everything directly. Its `CreateDevToolsTab` receives
`inspected_tab_id` as an integer, looks up `WebContents*` from its own `tabs_`
vector, and creates `new ShellDevToolsFrontend(shell, inspected_contents)` at
the end. The `WebContents*` never crosses a library boundary.

Profile Server also has **forked copies** of several DevTools files:

- `shell_devtools_frontend.h` — constructor moved from private to public
- `shell_devtools_frontend.cc`
- `shell_devtools_bindings.h`
- `shell_devtools_bindings.cc`
- `shell_devtools_manager_delegate.h`
- `shell_devtools_manager_delegate.cc`

Plusium uses the stock `content/shell/browser/` versions of these files (with
only the constructor visibility change from Issue 705 Experiment 12). If Profile
Server's forked DevTools files contain fixes or workarounds beyond the
constructor visibility change, Plusium would be missing them.

### Architecture difference

Plusium's `CreateDevToolsTab` receives `void* inspected` — a raw pointer to
`WebContents` that was cast to `void*` at the C API boundary in
`libtermsurf_content.cc`, passed through the IPC dispatch in `plusium_main.cc`,
and cast back to `WebContents*` inside `TsBrowserMainParts::CreateDevToolsTab`.
The pointer itself is valid at the time of the call (the function successfully
looks up the inspected tab's ID from `tabs_`). But by the time
`PrimaryMainDocumentElementAvailable` fires and `AttachInternal()` runs, the
stored pointer appears corrupted.

### Key files

- `content/libtermsurf_content/ts_browser_main_parts.cc` — `CreateDevToolsTab()`
  (Plusium's implementation)
- `content/chromium_profile_server/browser/shell_browser_main_parts.cc` —
  `CreateDevToolsTab()` (Profile Server's working implementation)
- `content/shell/browser/shell_devtools_frontend.h` — constructor (now public)
- `content/shell/browser/shell_devtools_frontend.cc` — `Show()`,
  `PrimaryMainDocumentElementAvailable()`
- `content/shell/browser/shell_devtools_bindings.cc` — `AttachInternal()`, where
  the crash happens
- `content/chromium_profile_server/browser/shell_devtools_bindings.cc` — Profile
  Server's forked version (may differ from stock)
- `content/plusium/plusium_main.cc` — Plusium binary, IPC dispatch
- `content/libtermsurf_content/libtermsurf_content.cc` — C API exports

### Chromium branch

`146.0.7650.0-issue-705` (forked from `146.0.7650.0-issue-704`)

## Ideas for experiments

1. **Debug the pointer.** Add `LOG(INFO)` in `ShellDevToolsBindings` constructor
   and `AttachInternal()` to print the inspected `WebContents*` address at both
   points. If they differ, the pointer is being corrupted in storage. If they
   match, the object itself was destroyed or relocated between construction and
   attach.

2. **Diff Profile Server's forked DevTools files against stock.** Profile Server
   has forked copies of `shell_devtools_bindings.cc`,
   `shell_devtools_frontend.cc`, and `shell_devtools_manager_delegate.cc`. Diff
   them against the stock `content/shell/browser/` versions. Any differences
   beyond the constructor visibility change could explain why Profile Server
   works and Plusium doesn't.

3. **Look up by tab_id instead of pointer.** Change Plusium's C API to accept
   `inspected_tab_id` (an integer) instead of `void* inspected` for
   `CreateDevToolsTab`. Look up the `WebContents*` internally from
   `TsBrowserMainParts::tabs_` — the same way Profile Server does. This
   eliminates the pointer ever crossing the C API boundary.

4. **Component build investigation.** The build uses
   `is_component_build = true`. `DevToolsAgentHost::GetOrCreateForTab()` lives
   in `libcontent.dylib`, while `ShellDevToolsBindings::AttachInternal()` lives
   in the `plusium` binary. Test whether the pointer is valid when
   `AttachInternal()` is called but gets corrupted crossing the dylib boundary
   into `libcontent.dylib`.

5. **Use Profile Server's forked DevTools files.** If the diff (idea 2) reveals
   significant differences, link Plusium against Profile Server's forked
   DevTools files instead of the stock ones. This is the most direct path to
   matching Profile Server's behavior, though it increases coupling.
