# Issue 679: License and Trademark

Set up licensing for TermSurf. The software should be open source, but the
"TermSurf" brand (name, logo, icons) must be protected. Copyright belongs to
Identellica LLC.

## Background

### Upstream Licenses

TermSurf builds on two major open-source projects. Both use permissive licenses.

**Ghostty — MIT License**

The GUI (`gui/`) is a Ghostty fork. Ghostty uses the MIT License:

```
MIT License

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy

```

MIT obligations:

- Include the original copyright notice and license in all copies or substantial
  portions
- That's it — no other restrictions

**Chromium — BSD 3-Clause License**

The browser engine (`chromium/`) is a Chromium fork. Chromium uses BSD 3-Clause:

CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY,

```

BSD 3-Clause obligations:

- Retain copyright notice in source distributions
- Reproduce copyright notice in binary distributions
- Do not use "Google" or contributor names to endorse the product

**Chromium's trademark precedent:** Google explicitly separates the open-source
code (BSD) from the "Chrome" trademark. The Chrome name, logo, and branded
assets are NOT open source. Chromium (the open-source project) has its own
branding. This is the same model TermSurf should follow.

### Other Upstream Dependencies

- **Nerd Fonts** (`gui/vendor/nerd-fonts/`) — SIL Open Font License v1.1 (fonts)
  - MIT (source code). Compatible with MIT.
- **Rust crates** (`tui/`) — Various permissive licenses (MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD).
  All compatible with MIT.
- **Zig packages** (`gui/build.zig.zon`) — Various permissive licenses. All
  compatible with MIT.

### License Compatibility

MIT and BSD 3-Clause are both permissive and fully compatible. TermSurf can use
MIT for its own code while satisfying both upstream obligations. The only
requirement is to include the original copyright notices from Ghostty and
Chromium.

### Trademark Strategy

Many open-source projects separate code licenses from brand protection:

- **Chromium/Chrome** — Code is BSD, "Chrome" is a Google trademark
- **Firefox/Mozilla** — Code is MPL, "Firefox" is a Mozilla trademark
- **Rust** — Code is MIT/Apache 2.0, "Rust" is a Rust Foundation trademark
- **Linux** — Code is GPL, "Linux" is a Linus Torvalds trademark

TermSurf should follow this pattern: MIT license for code, trademark protection
for the "TermSurf" name and logo.

### What We Need

1. **`LICENSE`** at repo root — MIT License, Copyright Identellica LLC
2. **`TRADEMARKS.md`** at repo root — reserves "TermSurf" name and logo
3. **`NOTICE`** at repo root — third-party copyright notices (Ghostty, Chromium)
4. Keep `gui/LICENSE` intact (Ghostty's original MIT license)

## Experiment 1: Create license files

### Hypothesis

Adding LICENSE, TRADEMARKS.md, and NOTICE files will properly license the
software as open source while protecting the TermSurf brand.

### Changes

#### 1. Create `LICENSE`

MIT License with Identellica LLC copyright. Year 2025 (project inception).

#### 2. Create `TRADEMARKS.md`

Reserve "TermSurf", the TermSurf logo, and related branding. Clarify that forks
must use a different name. This is a policy document, not a legal instrument —
actual trademark registration is separate.

#### 3. Create `NOTICE`

Third-party attributions required by upstream licenses:

- Ghostty MIT notice (required by MIT: "shall be included in all copies or
  substantial portions")
- Chromium BSD notice (required by BSD: "reproduce the above copyright notice")

#### 4. Keep `gui/LICENSE` unchanged

Ghostty's original MIT license stays in place inside the fork directory.

### Test

1. `LICENSE` exists at repo root with MIT + Identellica LLC
2. `TRADEMARKS.md` exists with brand protection language
3. `NOTICE` exists with Ghostty and Chromium attributions
4. `gui/LICENSE` is unchanged (still Ghostty's MIT)
5. No conflicts between TermSurf's MIT and upstream licenses

### Result: PASS

All three files created. `LICENSE` has MIT with Identellica LLC copyright.
`TRADEMARKS.md` reserves the TermSurf name and logo with clear permitted/not
permitted uses. `NOTICE` includes full Ghostty MIT and Chromium BSD 3-Clause
copyright texts. `gui/LICENSE` unchanged.

## Conclusion

TermSurf is now properly licensed. MIT for the code, trademark protection for
the brand — the same model used by Chromium/Chrome, Firefox/Mozilla, and Rust.

- `LICENSE` — MIT, Copyright (c) 2025 Identellica LLC
- `TRADEMARKS.md` — "TermSurf" name and logo reserved, forks must rebrand
- `NOTICE` — Ghostty and Chromium upstream attributions
