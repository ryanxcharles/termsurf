# Issue 703: Remove click-to-activate suppression

## Goal

Mouse clicks and drags should always propagate to content immediately, without
requiring a separate "activation" click first. Clicking a browser pane in
control mode should switch to browse mode AND forward the click. Clicking an
unfocused pane should focus it AND forward the click. The current behavior —
requiring one click to activate, then another to interact — is annoying in
practice.

Keyboard focus still follows the click (the clicked pane becomes the active pane
for keyboard input), but mouse events should never be swallowed.

## Background

Three issues built the current suppression system:

- **Issue 670** — Added `pane_activation` flag. When a pane gains focus, the
  first click is consumed (press and release swallowed). Rationale: panes should
  behave like OS windows, where click-to-focus doesn't pass through.
- **Issue 695** — Extended suppression to drags. Added early return in
  `cursorPosCallback` when `pane_activation` is set, so mouse movement during
  the suppressed click doesn't leak to Chromium.
- **Issue 696** — Fixed double-suppression bug where both `pane_activation` and
  `overlay_activation` fired on the same click, requiring three clicks to
  interact. Removed the redundant `overlay_activation` set from
  `paneFocusChanged()` and added keyboard-clears-suppression in `keyCallback()`.

The overlay_activation flag (from Issue 606 Experiment 8) is now dead code — it
is never set to `true` anywhere. Issue 696 removed the only place that set it.

## Analysis

There are two suppression mechanisms to remove:

### 1. Pane activation suppression (`pane_activation` flag)

When a pane gains focus via `focusCallback()`, `pane_activation` is set to
`true`. This causes:

- `mouseButtonCallback()` (line ~4055): returns early, swallowing press+release.
- `cursorPosCallback()` (line ~4867): returns early, swallowing drag.
- `keyCallback()` (line ~2740): clears the flag (keyboard engagement bypass).

**To remove:** Delete the flag declaration, all places that set it, and all
guards that check it.

### 2. Overlay activation suppression (`overlay_activation` flag)

This flag was designed to suppress the click that transitions from control mode
to browse mode. It is now dead code — never set to `true` — but the guards still
exist:

- `mouseButtonCallback()` (line ~4069): checks `overlay_activation` to suppress
  press+release on the overlay.
- `mouseButtonCallback()` (line ~4120): clears `overlay_activation` when click
  misses overlay.

**To remove:** Delete the flag declaration and all guards.

### 3. Control→browse click forwarding

Currently, when a browser pane is in control mode and the user clicks the
overlay, `notifyOverlayClicked()` switches to browse mode but does NOT forward
the click to Chromium. The click is consumed by the mode switch.

After removing suppression, this click should both switch to browse mode AND
forward to Chromium, so the user's click lands where they intended.
