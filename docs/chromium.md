No `origin` remote for now. Remote hosting TBD (likely patch set distribution).

## Current State

- Branch: `146.0.7650.0-issue-639`
- Base version: `146.0.7650.0` (tracking Electron's Chromium version)

## Branch Strategy

Track the same Chromium version as Electron. Branches are named
`{version}-termsurf` for the main working branch and `{version}-issue-{N}` for
issue-specific branches.

**Every issue gets its own branch.** When modifying Chromium for a new issue,
find the most relevant recent branch, create a new branch from it
(`{version}-issue-{N}`), and add it to the Branches table below.

## Patches

Every TermSurf branch is archived as `git format-patch` output in
`chromium/patches/`. Each subdirectory contains the complete patch set from the
`146.0.7650.0` tag to the branch tip.

To reconstruct a branch:

```bash
cd chromium/src
git checkout 146.0.7650.0
git checkout -b 146.0.7650.0-issue-{N}
git am ../../chromium/patches/issue-{N}/*.patch
```

After committing to a Chromium branch, regenerate its patches:

```bash
cd chromium/src
rm -rf ../../chromium/patches/issue-{N}/
git format-patch 146.0.7650.0..HEAD -o ../../chromium/patches/issue-{N}/
```

Then commit the updated patches in the main repo.

See [chromium/README.md](../chromium/README.md) for the full directory layout.

## Local Setup

The `chromium/` directory at the repo root is a Chromium build workspace,
gitignored from the main repo. The `src/` subdirectory is the Chromium git repo
(Chromium requires it to be named `src/`). `depot_tools/` lives at
`chromium/depot_tools/`. To set up from scratch, use `fetch chromium` from
depot_tools or clone from upstream and apply our patches (patch distribution
TBD).

```
chromium/
├── depot_tools/   — Chromium build tools (gclient, gn, autoninja, etc.)
└── src/           — Chromium source tree (git repo)
    ├── content/   — Content API (where our code lives)
    └── out/       — Build output
```

## Build

Set the PATH so that `gn` and `autoninja` are available:

```bash
cd chromium/src
export PATH="$(cd ../depot_tools && pwd):$PATH"
```

Configure the build (one time):

```bash
gn gen out/Default --args='is_debug=false symbol_level=0 is_component_build=true'
```

Build a target:

```bash
autoninja -C out/Default chromium_profile_server
```

Build times: ~1.5 hours for a full build, 15–20 seconds incremental.

### Never use `ninja` directly

Always use `autoninja`, never `ninja`. Chromium's build system uses Siso (a
Ninja replacement). `autoninja` routes builds through Siso automatically. If
`ninja` is invoked directly — even once — it creates `.ninja_deps` state files
that permanently downgrade the build directory to Ninja. Every subsequent
`autoninja` invocation will detect the Ninja state and fall back to Ninja,
printing:

> You're still using Ninja. Please run 'gn clean out/Default' when convenient to
> upgrade this output directory to Siso (Chromium's Ninja replacement).

The only recovery is `gn clean out/Default`, which deletes the entire build
cache (preserving only `args.gn`) and forces a full rebuild (~1.5 hours).

### Recovery

If the build directory is contaminated with Ninja state:

```bash
cd chromium/src
export PATH="$(cd ../depot_tools && pwd):$PATH"
gn clean out/Default
autoninja -C out/Default chromium_profile_server
```

This cleans the directory, and `autoninja` will use Siso from that point
forward.
