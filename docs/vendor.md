# Vendor Repos

Cloned repos for reading source code and learning. These are gitignored and not
committed to the TermSurf repo.

## libghostty dependency sources (Issue 801)

Upstream sources for the third-party libraries Ghostty depends on, cloned for
**reading and study only**. Per
[Issue 801](../issues/0801-roastty-libghostty-rewrite/README.md), these are
**reimplemented in Rust** — never vendored, linked, or built. They are gitignored
(`vendor/.gitignore`) like the analysis repos above.

Pinned tags (`z2d`, `uucode`) are cloned at the exact version Roastty is
reimplementing; the rest are the default branch. Ghostty's exact pins live in
`vendor/ghostty/build.zig.zon` (Zig libs) and `vendor/ghostty/pkg/<name>/` (C
libs).

Not cloned (out of scope per the issue's macOS-only constraint): `fontconfig`,
`gobject`/GTK, `gtk4-layer-shell`, `wayland` (+ protocols), `opengl`, `libintl`,
and the font/theme/SDK asset packages.

## Chromium (special case)

Chromium lives at `chromium/src/` (not in `vendor/`). The repo is too large to
have two clones, so `chromium/src/` serves double duty: it is both the build
workspace for TermSurf's Chromium fork and the source code reference. When
studying Chromium internals (e.g., `WebContentsObserver`, Content API, compositor
pipeline), read from `chromium/src/` directly.
